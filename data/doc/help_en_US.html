<br>
<br>
</em></div>
<strong>Getting started using OpenCPN consists of 3 basic steps:</strong>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#Installing%20OpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN </em></a></li>
    <li><a href="#Installing%20Charts"><em>Installing Charts</em> </a>to be read by OpenCPN</li>
    <li>*(Optional) <a href="#Setting%20Up%20GPS"><em>Setting Up GPS</em></a> to "talk" to your computer and OpenCPN</li>
</ol>
Completing these 3 steps will get you started and allow you to check out
 the program.  Later, after exploring the program, you may want to read 
through the <a href="#Basic%20Features"><em>Basic Features</em> </a>and <a href="#Advanced%20Features"><em>Advanced Features</em> </a>sections
 to really get a good grasp of what the program offers.  If you still 
have questions or would just like to get in touch with other OpenCPN 
users, there is also a fairly large community behind OpenCPN. You can 
find us in this Cruiser's &gt;forum.<br>

<br>
If you are installing OpenCPN for the first time on a computer with  
Ubuntu, or any other Linux flavor, you have to go through a few steps to
  make sure that all dependencies are met. Ubuntu uses "deb" packages 
and  Fedora uses the "rpm" packages.<br>
<br>
To make sure that sound works in OpenCPN, we have had to start with an 
extra step in the Linux installation process. The reason for this is 
that the libwxgtk Ubuntu package does not contain one option that is 
essential for OpenCPN.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Install a version of libwxgtk2.8-0 that is compiled with support
 for sdl -     Simple DirectMedia Layer.     Such versions are available
 from <a title="http://apt.wxwidgets.org" href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/">http://apt.wxwidgets.org</a>.<br>
    Download the correct package for your version of Debian or Ubuntu and<br>
    <br>
    $sudo dpkg -i ibwxgtk2.8XXXXXX (the proper name of the downloaded version)<br>
    <br>
    or, follow these instructions: <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian">wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian</a>, to add apt.wxwidgets.org as a source for packages.</li>
    <li>It is recommended that you install the "xcalib" program, that is
 necessary to dim the screen for night time usage. Use your favorite 
package manager or just issue <em>$sudo apt-get install xcalib </em>from the command line.</li>
    <li>On Ubuntu, start "System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Synaptic". In 
Synaptic  go to "Settings-&gt;Repositories" and tick the box 
"Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)". Close Synaptic.</li>
    <li>Download the correct .deb or .rpm from <a href="http://opencpn.org/download">Download OpenCPN</a>.</li>
    <li>Use the stable release for navigation en route, or if you just started using OpenCPN.</li>
    <li>Click on the downloaded package. An installation manager will 
guide you on most Linux distributions. All dependencies should 
automatically be installed. If you have problems with dependencies, run 
the recommended command line in the next paragraph.</li>
    <li>sudo gdebi<span> </span>&lt;downloaded_opencpn_file.deb&gt;. The command "gdebi" will automatically install the dependencies for you.</li>
    <li>It is also possible to install the package via dpkg or rpm, on 
the condition that all dependencies are met.To make sure that this is 
the case on Ubuntu, open a terminal window to get a command line, 
(Applications-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Terminal) and copy and paste the 
following line: "<em>sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0  libwxbase2.8-0 wx-common  libglu1-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx zlib1g bzip2 gpsd gpsd-clients </em><em>xcalib</em>". Then proceed with the commands below<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <pre>For Ubuntu: $ sudo dpkg -i &lt;downloaded_file.deb&gt; 
For Fedora: # sudo yum install --nogpgcheck &lt;downloaded_file.rpm&gt;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>The binary will be installed to <strong>/</strong><strong>usr/local/bin/opencpn</strong> and the static data used by the program will be in <strong>/usr/local/share/opencpn  <br>
        </strong></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If this is a new installation, click on the Toolbox icon <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absMiddle"> and configure your GPS source, chart directories, and other settings.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Other 32 and 64bit Linux Distributions and the BSD operating systems.">Other 32 and 64bit Linux Distributions and the BSD operating systems.</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Currently other distributions requires compiling the source. 
This will involve resolving various dependencies and is for folks 
comfortable with developing on Linux.</li>
    <li>Download the source from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpn/files/opencpn/2.3.1/OpenCPN-2.3.1-Source.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net </a> or directly from the Git server.

<h3 id="Mac OSX">Mac OSX</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Mac package is a dmg file, and the standard installation method works. If in doubt search the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Different versions of OpenCPN">Different versions of OpenCPN</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use a "stable", official release for actual navigation. The 
latest stable release is always available at the top of the download 
page or from Source Forge.</li>
    <li>Beta releases are snapshots of the development process, and may 
contain errors or temporarily be unstable. Show stoppers are normally 
fixed very quickly however. This is where the latest features first are 
seen. Most of the time the beta releases are quite stable and the 
OpenCPN team appreciate it if more experienced users test the releases 
and report back. The place to report bugs and suggest features is <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a>. To reach <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a> from the OpenCPN Web pages click on the "Tracker" tab at the upper right (above the blue bar).</li>
    <li class="rteleft">To see what version you are using either look in
  ?-&gt;about or at the top of your display. A lot of information is 
also available in the log file. See below.<br>

</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="Location of Important Files. Log and config files."><strong><a name="#"></a>Location of Important Files. Log and config files.<br>
</strong></h3>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
    <li> It is important to know the location of the <strong>log file</strong> and the configuration file,<strong> opencpn.conf</strong>(Linux)<strong> </strong>or<strong> opencpn.ini</strong>
 (Windows), on your computer. If you ask questions on the forum, there 
is a fair chance that you will be asked about the content in these 
files. Once you get familiar with OpenCPN, have a look at the files!</li>
    <li>Through out this documentation there will be many references to 
the configuration file, as it often is possible to change the default 
settings. This is an advanced subject once you are familiar with 
OpenCPN. All editing in the config files must be done with a 
text-editor, such as "notepad" in Windows.</li>
    <li>The configuration file is where all data, that needs to be 
persistent between sessions, are stored. The logfile keeps tab of what's
 going on in the current session.                          </li>
    <li>To find the locations of the files go to the ToolBar click on 
"About OpenCPN", the button furthest to the right. Look at the bottom  
of the "About" Tab, highlighted below. The illustration below is from a 
Win XP. A quick way to view the logfile is to copy the full file path 
and then paste this into the address field in a web browser.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/about.png" alt="" height="530" width="510"></li>
    <li>On <strong>Linux</strong> the "opencpn.log" is in your home directory.<br>
    The "opencpn.conf" is in a hidden directory, called "opencpn", also in your home directory. <br>
    For a quick way to view the files you can try these commands.<br>
    $gedit `echo $HOME/opencpn.log`<br>
    $gedit `echo $HOME/.opencpn/opencpn.conf`<br>
    Of course you can swap "gedit" for your favorite editor.</li>
    <li>On <strong>Windows 2000, XP and Vista and Windows 7 </strong>the
 two files are more difficult to find, so use the "About" dialog as 
described above.  Note that some folders in the path to the log and ini 
files may be hidden. Change the global folder and file settings to make 
hidden and system files visible, also change settings so that all file 
extensions are shown.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="If something goes wrong"><a name="#"></a>If something goes wrong</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you have installed OpenCPN successfully and later run into 
trouble there is generally no point in reinstalling. It is a very common
 reaction among users, but achieves very little.</li>
    <li>First check your logfile and try to find a hint there.</li>
    <li>Next step would be to rename the configuration file - 
opencpn.ini. Close the application first though. When you start OpenCPN 
again it will be like a new install, no chart directories and all 
settings are default.</li>
    <li>If this is successful, please post your old config file, 
together with full information of what happened and your system, on the 
Cruisers Forum. To do this, first rename the file by adding ".doc" to 
the end of the file name.</li>
    <li>This will help the OpenCPN developers  to understand what's going on.</li>
    <li>Still having trouble? Post a question to the <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/">Forum.</a></li>

  <h1 id="OpenGL" class="book-heading">OpenGL</h1>
  <br>
<strong>What is OpenGL an Overview</strong><br>
OpenGL is an open standard, cross platform, advanced graphic library. It
  uses the graphic cards processor (GPU) and memory, to speed up 
applications.  With OpenCPN a user with a typical modern graphic card 
will have an enhanced experience. Much faster and smoother zooming and 
panning as well as clearer and sharper chart rendering.<br>
<br>
In OpenCPN OpenGL is a choice, the old graphic engine is still there. 
OpenGL will not work for everyone. Performance may not be improved with 
embedded graphics chips, often found in older laptops and netbooks.<br>
<br>
Microsoft has gone from support to hostility towards OpenGL. There is 
currently a lot of trouble with OpenGL on Vista and W7 for all OpenGL 
applications, not just OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
For Linux the situation is slightly different. Linux supports OpenGL, as
 it generally tends to support open standards. The user is however 
dependent on a driver from the graphic cards maker, and their support 
for OpenGL. This may change with projects like <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/">nouveau</a>, a free driver for nVidias cards.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/nogl.png" alt="" height="167" width="200">        <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/gl.png" alt="" height="172" width="200"><br>
Without OpenGL                         With OpenGL<br>
Heavy over zooming reveals some of the secrets behind OpenGL<br>
  <br>
<strong>Why introduce OpenGL in OpenCPN?<br>
</strong> The main reasons are:
<ul>
    <li><strong> </strong>Better performance, leveraging modern PC graphics cards that are ubiquitous and powerful.</li>
    <li>Better "eye candy", such as smooth zoom and pan, with little impact on responsiveness.</li>
    <li>Future cross-platform support (e.g Android/IOS)</li>
    <li>Some features depends on OpenGL, such as horizontal text and numbers on skewed (course up) vectorcharts.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Is OpenGL a good choice for everyone?</strong><br>
OpenCPNs performance with OpenGL is highly dependent upon your graphics hardware and drivers.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Some graphics chip sets (e.g.intel 945G) have rather   poor 
OpenGL driver support, so that we cannot fully utilize the hardware   
acceleration potential of these systems.</li>
    <li>nVidia graphics, even very old cards, seem to perform very well.</li>
    <li>Performance may not be improved with embedded graphics chips as often found in older laptops and netbooks.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of trouble with OpenGL on Vista and W7. Microsoft
 implemented a new screen compositing model for Vista and later, which 
"broke" many OpenGL apps</li>
    <li>Conclusion:Using OpenGL with OpenCPN will be a significant 
upgrade for some users of OpenCPN, but OpenGL may not be "better" for 
everyone's OCPN application.</li>
    <li>So, user's choice.  If OpenGL works better for you, then use it.
   If  not, the old DC based graphics render system is still in place,  
 with performance equivalent to Version 2.5.0.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Start using OpenGL</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Find the latest driver for your graphic card. The driver that 
came with your operating system, is not likely to be the best. Start 
looking at your graphic card makers home page.</li>
    <li>Go to the ToolBox-&gt;Settings and tick the two boxes "Use OpenGL" and "Enable Smooth Panning/Zooming".</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other tricks</strong><br>
If you have a lot of graphic memory, or very little, try to add the following to your config (ini on windows) file:<br>
"GPUMemorySize=nnn"<br>
where nnn is graphics card memory size, in MBytes.<br>
256 MBytes is the default.<br>  </div>
<div id="node-154" class="section-4">
  <h1 id="Low Power Systems" class="book-heading">Low Power Systems</h1>
  This is an advanced subject. Beginners need only bother, if on a 
system with very low resources and if the system feels very sluggish. 
The background is that OpenCPN, quite aggressively uses memory, to speed
 up the application, this can backfire in certain situations....<br>
<br>
There is a simple memory management scheme, for use with systems that has limited resources.<br>
Two modes are available, only one of which can be active at any given 
time. The mode must be specified in the "opencpn.conf" file, called 
"opencpn.ini" in Windows.<br>
<br>
1.  Application memory limit target.  Try to limit the total memory used  by OCPN to the specified value, approximately.  <br>
Specify this mode by:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
MEMCacheLimit=xxx<br>
......<br>
Where xxx is memory use target in Mbytes.  Overrides NCacheLimit below.<br>
<br>
2.  Open chart limit.  This is the default mode under Linux, and the default value is 20 open charts at any one time.<br>
<br>
Modify this limit by the following:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
NCacheLimit=yy<br>
......<br>
Where yy is the maximum number of simultaneously open charts.<br>
<br>
If you do not enter any memory management specification in the config file, the following defaults apply:<br>
<br>

  The OpenCPN portable option allows the program to run fron an USB 
stick, or run independent from and parallel to a normal installation.<br>
To differ between various instances of the program, the titlebar on portable versions looks like this.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/portable.png" alt="" height="31" width="605"> <br>
It is thus possible to run multiple portable instances and identify each version.<br>
<br>

<br>
The following files/directories/folders must be in the directory containing the OpenCPN executable:<br>
<br>
1.  OpenCPN.exe (of course)<br>
2.  "opencpn portable.bat" (or other name of user choice)<br>
A MSDOS batch file containing the one line:<br>
"opencpn -p"<br>
3.  msvcr100.dll<br>
4.  msvcp100.dll<br>

7.  license.txt<br>
<br>
To run OpenCPN portably within this directory, simply execute the  
"opencpn portable" batch file. There may be a way to build a click-able 
 shortcut to OpenCPN, with the -p option specified in the shortcut. But I
  could not figure it out.  Windows insists upon a drive letter in the  
command line of the shortcut, which would defeat the whole purpose of  
portability.<br>
Thus, the batch file....<br>
I find that this works pretty well from a USB stick...<br>
<br>
<h3 id="A Linux version">A Linux version</h3>
<br>
On Linux, a similar functionality exists.<br>
Copy the opencpn executable binary and the data directories mentioned above to a local directory.<br>
In that directory, do<br>
$ ./opencpn -p<br>
This will cause all user data files to be created and used from within that local directory.<br>
This can be useful for side-by-side testing...<br>

<strong>OpenCPN </strong>does<strong> </strong>not come with any pre-installed charts<strong>. </strong>It is up to the user to find and install charts<strong>. </strong>Read
 on, and you will find detailed information about which chart formats 
that OpenCPN can display, as well as pointers to all available free 
charts that we know of.<strong> <br>
<br>
To install charts, OpenCPN must be pointed to a directory containing Charts of one of the recognized  </strong><a href="#Chart%20Formats"><em><strong>Chart Formats</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Don't point OpenCPN to individual charts. You must specify the directory that contains the charts. Download some charts (see <a href="#Chart%20Sources"><em>Chart Sources</em></a>)
 and organize them in a fashion that suits you.  You may want to 
consider storing them in a directory where they will not be tampered 
with or moved accidentally.<br>
Open the Toolbox by clicking <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/settings.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">.  You are sent to the first tab "Settings". Tick the box "Show Chart Outlines". That will help you visualize the loaded charts.<br>
  <br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/outline.png" alt="" height="317" width="600"><br>
<br>
Then click the tab "Charts".<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/chart-tab_1.png" alt="" height="725" width="600"><br>
<br>
Under "Available Chart Directories" navigate to your chart-directory.  
When clicking the button "Add Selection" the selected chart directory 
appears in the box "Active Chart Directories". The screen-shots are from
 Linux, but this process works similarly on all platforms. All that 
remains is to click the "Ok" button. OpenCPN will then process your 
selection. You can now start using your charts. <br>
<strong><u>Note that in OpenCPN you must add directories (folders) containing charts, not individual charts.</u></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Eager to get some charts quickly, to get started?</strong> Go to:  <a href="#Chart%20Sources"><em>Chart Sources</em></a><br>
<br>
<strong>Start using your charts</strong>.<br>
You can click and drag the chart with your mouse. The cursor changes to 
an triangular green arrow near the edges of the OpenCPN window, left 
clicking in this situation, pans the chart in the direction of the 
arrow. The scroll wheel zooms in and out. Left clicking anywhere centers
 the view on that position. Right clicking brings up a menu with useful 
actions. Exactly what the menu contains depends on the circumstances. 
Read the rest of the manual for a full explanation.<br>
<br>
If you are running OpenCPN for the first time you may see a black 
background instead of the charts you installed.  That simply means 
OpenCPN is pointed at a location that is not on any of the charts you 
installed.  Click and drag, or use the arrow keys, to move the 
view-point to the  location of one of your installed charts as described
 under "<strong>A few hints</strong>" below. An alternative is to 
right-click, and then click "Jump to position". Enter a location that is
 within the perimeters of your entered charts. The first time you start 
OpenCPN the view will be centered on Georgetown in South Carolina.<br>

<strong>Starting with vector charts?</strong><br>
If you are new to vector charts, including CM93 v2, on OpenCPN follow this quick-start guide:<br>
<br>
1 Go to ToolBox <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/settings_002.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">-&gt;Vector Charts and copy the settings below for the Display Category.<br>
<br>
<div class="rteleft"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/default.png" alt="" height="336" width="206"></div>
<br>
2 Press this button <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/text.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> in the ToolBar to toggle text display.<br>
<br>
These are not the perfect settings, but you will see most of what you expect from a vector chart.<br>
As soon as you have made yourself reasonably comfortable with OpenCPN 
and before using Vector Charts for actual navigation, make sure you 
understand all the settings in the ToolBox-&gt; Vector Chart Tab by 
reading the <a href="#Vector%20Charts"><em>Vector Charts</em></a> page.<strong><br>
Loading Vector Charts</strong><br>
When using a vector chart for the first time OpenCPN has to process the 
 data, and transform the information to an internal display format. This
  can take some time, depending on your computer. This internal SENC 
chart is saved for future use. The created files are quite large, but is
 in a format optimized for quick loading. The SENC files are saved in 
the SENC directory in the same place as the opencpn.conf file 
-opencpn.ini on windows.<br>
You probably do not want to build SENCs for all of your loaded S57 ENCs unless you plan to actually go there....<br>
For an advanced approach to building SENC files <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/troubleshooting#init">look here.</a><br>
<strong>Updating Vector Charts</strong><br>
Publishers of Vector Charts, such as NOAA and EAHC issues regular 
updates. OpenCPN updates the created SENCs automatically. The chart 
itself, the base-chart, is named "name".000 , the first update is 
"name".001 and so on. As a user you only have to make sure that the 
update files are saved in the same place as the base-chart. In the case 
of a new edition of the chart a new "name".000 file is issued. Just 
replace the old file with the new file and OpenCPN will update the SENC 
file. Don't forget to remove the updates to the old edition of the 
chart.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 Charts</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/cmgrid1.png" alt="" height="746" width="600"><br>
<br>
CM93-version2 Charts are different from the S57 vector charts, and has 
it's own data structure consisting of a number of folders and files. To 
load these charts in OpenCPN just add the top directory to the list of 
"Active Chart Directories"<br>
The CM93 top directory contains a number of (144) subdirectories named from<br>
"00300000" to "04501020", as well as six other files. These sub 
directories each cover a geographical area of 40° x 40° . The first four
 numbers describes the latitude and the last four, the longitude of the 
SW corner of the area covered.<br>
The key to understanding the numbers is to realize that CM93's coordinate system<br>
of the world starts at the South Pole or to be exact at lat -90° long 0° and from there<br>
proceeds North a East with a factor of 3 for each degree of lat and long.<br>
The tile 00300000 hence has the SW corner at lat from -90° + 0030:3 = -80° or 80°S to<br>
and longitude  0°E , and covers the area from 80°S latitude to 40°S and from 0° longitude to 40°E.<br>
Looking at 04501020 it brakes down to lat -90° + 0450:3 = 60° and long 
1020:3 = 340° subtracting 360° results in -20° or 20°W. So we have he SW
 corner at 60°N and 20°W .<br>
One more example, the tle 03900840 has the SW corner at 40°N and 80°W.<br>
<br>
Each of these sub-directories in turn contains directories with the 
individual charts. Ordered in scale from smallest to largest they are 
Z,A,B,C,D,E,F and G. Where Z contains  overview charts and G contains 
harbor plans. Note that, generally, not all of these are present in each
 subdirectory.<br>
<br>
Z covers 40° x 40° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3.000.000 scale<br>
A covers 20° x 20° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:1.000.000 scale<br>
B covers 10° x 10° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:200.000 scale<br>
down to<br>
..<br>
G covers 20' x 20' and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3500 scale.<br>
The individual chart tiles in these directories have the same logic in the naming scheme as described above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>A few hints. </strong>
<ul>
    <li>If all is just black, with maybe some blue lines, you are 
viewing the background world vector shoreline chart. You must move to 
the geographical position of the charts you just loaded. As you come 
close you will see the outlines of your loaded charts, in red for raster
 charts and in green for S57 vector charts. Click in the rectangle 
created by the outlines, to activate, and view the chart.</li>
    <li>If you ticked the "Show Chart Outlines" box under the "Settings"
 tab the loaded charts will be outlined in red for raster and green for 
vector charts. In CM93 the charts will be outlined in purple. The 
smallest scale charts in CM93, the Z scale and A scale charts, will not 
be outlined. Neither will all available charts be visible as outlines at
 the same time. The reason for this is computing speed and clarity. 
Generally the next level or two of larger scale charts are shown. When 
large scale plans are available directly from A scale charts, with no 
intermediate charts, the outline of the larger scale charts will be 
visible from a zoom level between 1.5 and 2.0. Generally in areas where 
only A or Z scale charts are available, expect potentially dangerous 
omissions. <strong>Warning</strong>, do not use CM93 small scale charts alone for navigation without referring to other sources.</li>
    <li>Be aware that it is possible to "Over-zoom" charts in OpenCPN. A
 warning will appear on the display. Please respect that warning. It is 
recommended to not zoom more than a factor 2, for safe navigation. The 
actual zoom-factor appears in the lower right-hand corner of the 
display.</li>
    <li>It is safe and reasonably efficient to put all your charts <strong>except </strong>the
 CM93 database in one large directory, and set that directory in 
Toolbox-&gt;Charts. The CM93 database contains its own file and 
directory structure. The top-level directory only, of this database 
should be loaded, as described above, into OpenCPN.<br>
    If you do a lot of chart downloads, updates, etc., then it will be 
faster to break the charts folder into smaller groups, and specify them 
individually in the Toolbox-&gt;Charts dialog. Consider using <a href="#Chart%20Groups"><em>Chart Groups</em></a></li>
    <li>"<strong>Scan Charts and Update Database </strong>" Use this 
option if you have made any changes to the contents of your  chart 
directories, as for example after downloading new charts from  NOAA, 
etc. It need not be checked if directories are added or subtracted, as 
the  entire database will be scanned and updated automatically in this 
case.</li>
    <li>"<strong>Force Full Database Rebuild</strong>" is mainly aimed 
at users converting or correcting existing charts, in a situation where 
changes are made to the geo-referencing, outline of the chart, or other 
attributes in the kap file header section.</li>
    <li>OpenCPN,  supports  <strong>Mercator Charts, Transverse Mercator Charts, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Charts and Polyconical Charts</strong>
 (used in parts of US and Canada). Charts using other projections will 
be displayed as if they were Mercator charts, but they will not be used 
for quilting.  Most charts are using one of the "Mercator" projections, 
so this limitation is not too bad.<br>
    Other projections, such as <strong>Gnomonic</strong>, are mainly 
used in older, larger scale BA charts, for smaller areas, for example 
harbor plans, in scales larger than 1:50,000. <br>
    The errors introduced in OpenCPN by treating these charts as Mercator are generally small, but <strong>be aware of this limitation</strong>.</li>
    <li>OpenCPN is not suited for Polar Navigation N/S of about 70 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<strong>A Linux/Unix Note</strong><br>
These operating systems have a <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html">problem</a>
 handling chart names containing spaces and non ASCII characters. A 
typical example is Swedish chart names. To sort this out use the utility
 program <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/detox">"detox</a>". Detox changes the file names so space becomes "_"; "(" and ")" become "-"; and "å","ä" and "ö" become "a","a" and "o", etc.<br>
<br>
To see what "detox" suggests to do, try a dry run first, like this:<br>
<em>detox -n File_with_swedish_charts &gt; outfile</em><br>

<h2 id="Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7"><strong>Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7</strong></h2>
<br>
Note that the extensive use of the cheap gps mouse BU-353 as an example below, should only be seen as an illustration. <br>
<br>
<p>To use OpenCPN with a GPS, a GPS receiver is needed.</p>
<p>There are a variety of possible choices for a GPS receiver:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A computer, such as a Sony Vaio P has a built in GPS receiver</li>
    <li>A NMEA Expander to amplify a nmea stream to multiple listeners</li>
    <li>A handheld GPS receiver</li>
    <li>A dedicated GPS receiver</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this section describes using OpenCPN with a 
dedicated GPS receiver, however, the instructions for a dedicated 
receiver will be similar for any serial/USB connected NMEA data stream.</p>
<h4 id="A Dedicated GPS Receiver">A Dedicated GPS Receiver</h4>
<p>There are several companies making dedicated GPS receivers. The 
Supplementary Hardware section for GPS devices lists several 
manufacturers.</p>
<p>NMEA has traditionally been implemented as a serial protocol and 
therefore, even if a USB connection is used, there needs to be a USB to 
Serial Port conversion. The specific driver for the each GPS receiver 
will handle this conversion.<br>
 </p>
<h4 id="An Example - Configuring BU-353">An Example - Configuring BU-353</h4>
<p> It is not necessary to use the installation disk to setup the 
BU-353. Following the steps listed below will result in the latest 
driver being installed.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the latest driver from Prolific - <a href="http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A" title="http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A">http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A</a></li>
    <li>Unzip and install the driver</li>
    <li>Plug in the BU-353.</li>
    <li>Start -&gt; (Right Click) My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Hardware -&gt;Device Manager <br>
    or Start-&gt;Run devmgmt.msc</li>
    <li>Expand Ports</li>
    <li>Look for the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port” and note the com port number (e.g., COM4) <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/DeviceManager-1.jpg" alt="" align="textTop" height="610" width="410"></li>
     
    <li>Right click on the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port”. Choose Driver</li>
    <li>Select 4800 bits per second, 8 data bits, None parity, 1 stop bit, and None for Flow Control  <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Prolific.jpg" alt="" align="textTop" height="450" width="410"></li>
     
    <li>Start OpenCPN</li>
    <li>Click on the ToolBox Icon  <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings"></li>
    <li>Select GPS</li>
    <li>Under NMEA Data Source select the Com port noted in #6</li>
    <li>Choose OK</li>
    <li>Select Auto Follow to center the map over your GPS location</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>There is a small LED located on the BU-353. If the LED is off there is no power being received. Check the connection.</p>
<p>If the LED is solid it indicates the BU-353 is searching for a GPS signal. Try moving the GPS receiver to a clear location.</p>
<p>If the LED is flashing it indicates the BU-353 has a position fix and is transmitting data.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Try viewing the NMEA data stream in OpenCPN. Choose ToolBox-&gt;GPS-&gt;click Show GPS/NMEA Data Stream Window</li>
    <li>Alternatively, a diagnostic program is included on the 
installation CD called GPSInfo.exe. Launch this program to install the 
diagnostic utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it appears that the NMEA data stream is being received, the most 
likely issue is that OpenCPN is not centered over your location. Click 
AutoFollow to center the map at your GPS location.</p>
<h4 id="Known Issues">Known Issues</h4>
<p>If you change the USB port for the GPS receiver Prolific will 
reassign the COM port number. This will require repeating steps 4-12 
above.</p>
<p>On some computer / GPS receiver combinations when the computer 
resumes from Stand By the GPS receiver will no longer transmit its NMEA 
data stream, and only garbage instead of ASCII characters will be 
visible in the NMEA Data Stream Window. The red indicator led will not 
work.<br>
<br>
To change back to NMEA mode search for and download SIRFDemo.exe.<br>
Unpack and start. Set correct Baud rate and and com port as above.<br>
Click connect to data source button. Action -&gt; Switch to NMEA protocol, then exit.<br>
There are many more settings available in SIRFDemo.exe</p>
<p>An alternative workaround for this issue is provided by using a COM port splitter such as XPort <a href="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html" title="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html">http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html</a></p>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html">XPort</a>.</li>
    <li>Unzip it to a folder of your choice</li>
    <li>Double Click XPort.exe</li>
    <li>Set the Baud Rate to 4800</li>
    <li>Under Enable Ports add an entry for COM10</li>
    <li>Click “Find GPS”. The port returned should match the port identified in Step #6 in the Configuring BU-353 Section</li>
    <li>Select Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port in the check box section</li>
    <li>Return to OpenCPN</li>
    <li>Click on the ToolBox Icon <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absmiddle"></li>
    <li>Select GPS</li>
</ol>
Under NMEA Data Source change the Com port to COM10

<br>
<h2 id="Linux"><strong>Linux</strong></h2>
<p>Two methods are available, direct connection or through gpsd.<br>
We start with gpsd.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the gpsd and gpsd-clients packages<br>
    <ul>                  $ sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Go to Toolbox--&gt;GPS and select "Network LIBGPS" as your  
"NMEA Data Source", unless you have a gpsd version in the 2.8.x series( 
 Ubuntu 9.10  and other older distros). In this case choose   
Toolbox--&gt;GPS --&gt; "NMEA Data Source" --&gt;"Network GPSD". </li>
        <li>On Ubuntu 10.04 and later, that is really all you have to do. When you plug in your gps this will trigger gpsd to start.</li>
        <li>"xgps" is client that comes with the gpsd-clients package, and is useful for testing that the gps and gpsd is working properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Direct connection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Make sure that gpsd isn't running then connect your gps and
 start OpenCPN. On Ubuntu 12.04 the easiest way to achive this is to 
unistall gpsd.</li>
        <li>In the Toolbox--&gt;GPS --&gt; "NMEA Data Source" the  port 
where you plugged in your gps will come up. If you plugged in BU  353 
this will probably be /dev/ttyUSB0.</li>
        <li>Choose 4800 baud, unless you know that the gps is set to something else.</li>
        <li>The gps should now work....if not, check the NMEA data  
stream window. If only binary garbage is visible, the gps has to be  
reset to NMEA mode, see more about this above in windows section.</li>
        <li>To do this in Linux for BU 353 as well as many other  
gps:es, make sure that gpsd is running  and that the package  
"gpsd-clients" is installed. On Ubuntu 12.04 gpsd needs to be 
temporarily installed. Make sure to kill any instances of gpsd with the 
command "sudo killall gpsd"</li>
        <li>The command $gpsctl -n will put the GPS into NMEA mode.</li>
        <li>If that doesn't work, try $ gpsctl -f -n  /dev/ttyUSB0 .This
 will force a low-level access, bypassing gpsd. For more information: 
$man gpsctl</li>
        <li>More information is as always available through "man gpsctl" Close down OpenCPN before running gpsctl.<br>
                   <br>
        None of this is normally noticed when using gpsd, as this program reads both NMEA and SIRF binary sentences.</li>
        <li><strong>More Linux hints</strong></li>
        <li>If you can't connect to a physical port, such as 
/dev/ttyUSBO, indicated by a line in the opencpn.log file. Check that 
you, as a user, belongs to the group  "dialout". To see which groups you
 belong to, run the command "groups".  Not all Linux distributions add 
the user to this group by default. To add your self to the dialout group
 -&gt; "sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER"</li>
        <li>Check if gpsd is working: <br>
        $ ps aux | grep gpsd<br>
        nobody   12338  0.3  0.1   4124  1448 ?        S&lt;s  18:31   0:00 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock<br>
        you    12356  0.0  0.0   3036   800 pts/3    S+   18:32   0:00 grep --color=tty -d skip gpsd <br>
        This or similar responses indicate that gpsd is running. If  you

        <li>Run the command "$ls -lrtd /dev/*|tail -10", and see the  10
 latest created device files. Run this just after plugin in your gps  to
 see which device was created. <br>
         </li>
        <li>Determine which device your GPS is on your linux system  by 
checking the startup.  Look for a line that says something about  GPS 
and /dev/ttyUSB#                           <span>in the command</span> "dmesg"</li>
        <li>Or even better, after connecting a gps mouse, BU-353, we look for a dmesg by running this command.<br>
        <pre>$ dmesg | grep tty
and get this response back.
[13616.095305] usb 2-3: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0

</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Add a script to start gpsd, if this is not done by your  
distribution.  I saved mine as startgps and set the executable  
attribute.  Edit line 3 to match your device, ie /dev/ttyUSB0<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <pre>#!/bin/sh

    More user experience of setting up bluetooth GPS are welcome, as the

    <h4 id="Ubuntu 10.10 and older.">Ubuntu 10.10 and older.</h4>
    If you have a bluetooth GPS  you will need to first configure it  
through the standard Ubuntu Bluetooth "set up new device " proceedure. 
Once you have done that you will need to find what the address of the 
GPS is. To do that you run this command:<br>
    <br>
    "sudo hcitool scan"<br>
    <br>
    it will then start looking for the Bluetooth GPS and hopefully find your GPS. You should see something similar to:<br>
    <br>
    Scanning ...<br>
        00:1C:88:10:D3:4D    iBT-GPS<br>
    <br>
    In this case i have a IBT-GPS at address     00:1C:88:10:D3:4D   (Your GPS address will be different)<br>
    <br>
    Next we have to bind the GPS address to a "virtual" device OpenCPN 
understands in this case rfcomm0. We do this with the following command:<br>
    <br>
    sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D        Note put your GPS address in this line<br>
    <br>
    You should not have to run these commands  each time your linux is restarted as it will remeber your GPS address.<br>
    <br>
    Now all you need to do is go into OpenCPN Toolbox and select GPS. 
Now in the NMEA Data Source options select from the pulldown menu: 
"/dev/rfcomm0", or write it in the box, if not present as an 
alternative.<br>
    <br>
    Thats it - you should now have a Bluetooth GPS Connected.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ubuntu</strong><strong> 12.04</strong><br>
    -Pair GPS with bluetooth icon<br>
    -break connection with bluetooth icon<br>
    -get device id: sudo hcitool scan<br>
    -get channel for gps: sdptool records 00:02:78:0A:4E:E9 (put your actual number here)<br>
    -sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf  #edit rfcomm input file. Text should be:<br>
    <pre>	#
	# RFCOMM configuration file.
	#
	# $Id: rfcomm.conf,v 1.1 2002/10/07 05:58:18 maxk Exp $
	#

	rfcomm0 {
	        # Automatically bind the device at startup
	        bind yes;

	        # Bluetooth address of the device
	        device xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;

	        # RFCOMM channel for the connection
	        channel 1;#use channel number as provided by sdptool records XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

	        # Description of the connection
	        comment "Your GPS Device Here";
	}</pre>
    - sudo rfcomm release 0 (not strictly neccesary)<br>
    - sudo rfcomm connect 0 (you only need to to this once, not required if you reboot at this point)<br>
    ...connected /dev/rfcomm0 to 00:00:00:00:00:00 (whatever)<br>
    ...Press CTRL-C for hangup<br>
    in a seperate terminal, you can test the connection with rfcomm show /dev/rfcomm0<br>
    ...rfcomm0: 00:08:1B:14:18:B6 channel 1 connected [tty-attached]<br>
    your bluetooth GPS should now be working in open CPN. run sudo 
opencpn to check that it works (/dev/rfcomm0 under GPS NMEA data 
source). <br>
    if it works, try  running opencpn without sudo, chances are that you
 cannot see the gps. if this is the case, use the following fix: sudo 
usermod -a -G dialout $USER<br>
    <br>
    <h4 id="Fedora">Fedora</h4>
    Run "hcitool scan" to get the ID of your bluetooth gps device<br>
    Make a file "rfcomm.config" and put it in /etc/bluetooth.<br>
    This file is already present in Ubuntu, but needs editing for persistent connection.<br>
    <br>
    # RFCOMM configuration file.<br>
    #<br>
    # $Id: rfcomm.conf,v 1.1 2002/10/07 05:58:18 maxk Exp $<br>
    #<br>
    rfcomm0 {<br>
    # Automatically bind the device at startup<br>
    bind yes;<br>
    # Bluetooth address of the device<br>
    device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX;<br>
    # RFCOMM channel for the connection<br>
    channel 1;<br>
    # Description of the connection<br>
    comment "Your GPS Device Here";<br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    Change XX:XX:XX.... to your device ID<br>
    <br>
    Open Opencpn and write /dev/rfcomm0 as GPS NMEA device. Note that 
you can add it yourself by writing directly into the scroll down box.<br>
    Permissions for /dev/rfcomm0 are for group "dialout". Make sure you belong to that group.<br>
    The command "groups" will show all the groups you belong to.<br>
    Make sure that "gpsd" isn't running, issuing "killall gpsd" as root.<br>

    <h2 id="Mac OSX"><strong>Mac OSX</strong></h2>
    <br>
    Attaching a GPS device to a Mac is done via one of the USB ports. 
Whether using a device with its own USB lead or via a serial-USB adapter
 lead or an NMEA multiplexer with USB port, the appropriate OS X driver 
needs to be installed. Nearly all hardware uses one of just two chip 
makes: those from FTDI or Prolific. Both those companies make OS X 
drivers available on their web sites, but manufacturers of GPS devices 
usually package the driver with device.<br>
    <br>
    When the driver is installed and the device connected, start 
OpenCPN, select the Toolbox and click the GPS tab. Open the "NMEA Data 
Source" menu &amp; select the the device from the list. It is not always
 obvious which is the correct one, but in general the device will have a
 name starting: "/dev/cu." or "/dev/tty.". Some manufacturers make it 
obvious, like "/dev/cu.MiniPlex-99000125", but others may be more 
generic, like: "/dev/cu.usbserial". Set the "NMEA Baud Rate" to 4800 and
 click "OK". If the correct selection has been made, you should see the 
GPS status icon change from red to green.  <div id="node-93" class="section-4">
  <h1 id="GPS Status" class="book-heading">GPS Status</h1>
  The default Ownship icon is rendered as grey <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ship_grey.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19"> if there is no valid gps position fix available<br>
and like this when a gps fix is available <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ship_red.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19"><br>
<br>
The GPS  status is also indicated all the way to the right along the top
 of the screen, unless this position is covered by the floating ToolBar.
 The GPS status is then found bottom left.<br>
The status icons should be interpreted as fallows:<br>
<br>

<br>
In real life, various gps receivers may behave slightly different, especially when starting up and finding satellites. <br>
<br>
The GPS status, including available satellites, is also available as an instrument on the DashBoard.<br>

  OpenCpn uses some basic settings or limitations.<br>
<ul>
    <li>Courses are always true, not magnetic .</li>
    <li>Distances are measured in Nautical Miles (meters for very short distances, less than a cable).</li>
    <li>All distances and routes are calculated using Mercator Sailing, not Great Circle Sailing.</li>
    <li>Knots is used for speed.</li>
</ul>
These fundamental settings cannot be changed.<br>
Great Circles can be created with external programs and imported as gpx routes. See <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/node/133">here</a> and <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/planning_data">here</a>.<br>

  <h1 id="Toolbar Buttons" class="book-heading">Toolbar Buttons</h1>
  <p>The Toolbar is floating and can be placed anywhere on the screen, vertical or horizontal.<br>
Note the "grabber" symbol at the far right side of the toolbar.  Use 
this handle to drag the toolbar wherever you want it. The default 
position is horizontal and docked top left.<br>
It "snaps" to the edges.  Right click on the grabber, and the toolbar  
shifts to vertical format.  On Windows (at least), the toolbar dims down
  transparently until you roll over it.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/toolbar_buttons.png" alt="" height="42" width="700"></p>
<p>When a toggle button is pressed, it changes and becomes slightly 
larger, by adding an outer frame, and grayer. Se Show/Hide text label

  The right click menu is always available as long as the cursor is 
somewhere in the chart area. The content of this menu is context 
sensitive. If you are dealing with routes, clicking on a leg or waypoint
 for example, your menu contains more entries than  just clicking at a 
random position. Below, the basic entries are explained. Single chart 
mode is assumed. In quilting mode the top three entries are not 
displayed. The context specific entries are dealt with as the concerned 
feature is explained.  <br>

If you zoom in enough there will appear a warning "OverZoom" in the 
upper left part of the chart area. This means that you have zoomed in 
way to far, and is using the chart<br>
at a scale that was never intended, and that is not supported by the 
original survey. No new information will be seen, and the situation is 
potentially dangerous<br>
as it could give the impression of  increased distance between dangers.<br>
On a raster-chart pixelation  will be seen, but on a vector chart it is not so<br>
obvious when you have over zoomed. This is where the warning is useful.<br>
Your first action when the warning appears should be to zoom out at least one snap.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nigel Calder "How to read a Nautical Chart, 2003"</strong>, is 
recommended to all users who want to know more about charts, the surveys
 they are based on, and their horizontal and vertical  accuracy.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN allows quite a bit of over-zooming by default, but it is also 
possible to change this by editing a line in the opecpn.ini (config) 
file. Find this line:<br>
AllowExtremeOverzoom=1<br>
and change it to <br>
AllowExtremeOverzoom=0<br>
This will still allow over-zooming up to a factor of about 5, which is 
when the warning on the screen appears. A stricter recommendation based 
on how charts are compiled and their de facto accuracy, would limit this
 to a factor 2.<br>

<div id="node-37" class="section-3">
  <h1 id="Status Bar" class="book-heading">Status Bar</h1>
  <p>At the bottom of the display, is the Status Bar(s). Activated from 'Tool Box-Show Status Bar'.</p>
<p>The top line, 'Chart Selection Bar', has the following description.<br>
It shows all the available chart for the present view represented by one
 segment for each chart. The order between the segments represents the 
scale of the charts. Largest scale to the left, smallest to the right. 
If CM93 is available, it is always furthest to the right. <br>
The segmented color bars in the Status Bar represent:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blue for Raster</li>
    <li>Green For ENC's</li>
    <li>Brown/Yellow for CM93 charts</li>
    <li>The current chart displays as a lighter shade of its color, or 
if quilting is active, the charts currently making up the quilt are 
displayed in lighter shade.</li>
    <li>The Chart bar below consisting of 12 segments shows a quilt of 
two active charts. Five charts in the quilt are hidden, due to small 
scale. CM93 is in it's place, to the right. Four charts of larger scale 
than the present view are available. The largest scale chart is a 
Transverse Mercator chart.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/seg.png" alt="" height="97" width="700"></p>
<h3 id="Limitation">Limitation</h3>
The Chart Bar handles a maximum of 100 charts. The largest scale charts 
will be dropped first if more than 100 chart are available on a 
position. It is unlikely that this will be much of a limitation, but the
 possibility certainly exists if a lot of info charts, pilot charts and 
weather charts etc, are loaded. The syntom will be that large scale 
charts becomes impossible to display.<br>
<p><br>
When you hover the mouse pointer over the bar, and not in quilting mode, a thumbnail of the chart will appear under the <a href="#Scaling%20Charts"><em>Scaling Charts</em> </a>icons
 and a chart information box will pop up just above the button. If 
quilting is on, instead of a thumbnail, the chart represented by the 
button will be highlighted in a transparent reddish color. By clicking 
on the appropriate bar, or using the appropriate <a href="#Hot%20Keys%20and%20Shortcuts"><em>Hot Keys and Shortcuts</em></a>,
 you will switch to the chart shown in the thumbnail. This feature is 
especially useful if you wish to view an ENC or a Raster chart of the 
same area.</p>

 by the larger scale charts. To view these charts, right-click anywhere 
on a chart in the quilt and select "Remove this chart from quilt", one 
of these charts will now be shown in the quilt.<br>
The Brown right most button shows that CM93 version 2, charts are available for the area, but not currently displayed.<br>
The information box shows relevant information about the chart. We can 
see that the chart is  Polyconic, and because of this a warning is 
displayed for poor accuracy. The reason is, that although Polyconic

  <h1 id="Chart Quilting" class="book-heading">Chart Quilting</h1>
  Chart quilting is a way to display parts of several charts together on the screen, redrawn to the same scale.<br>
<br>
<strong>Limitation</strong><br>
Mercator charts, Transverse Mercator charts and Polyconic chart are 
quilted separately and don't mix. The transition from one form of 
quilting to the other is seamless. Black areas can appear in Tmerc and 
Polyconic quilt in areas where there is no chart cover.<br>
By quilting, any information available in the white border around a chart, will be hidden.<br>
To see this information hit "F9" to temporarily get into single mode display. <br>
Skewed charts don't quilt, unless the skew is less than 5°. <br>
<br>
<strong>Quick Start</strong><br>
Go to ToolBox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Enable Chart Quilting. Tick he box. 
Once quilting is on in the Toolbox, F9 becomes a toggle switch to 
temporarily get into single mode display. Zooming in, automatically 
brings up larger scale charts, if available. Panning reveals a 
continuous quilt of the available charts. If you started with a raster 
chart, only raster-charts, and perhaps CM93, will be in the quilt. The 
same logic applies to S57 Vector Charts (ENCS). Make sure you are 
familiar with the <a href="#Status%20Bar"><em>Status Bar</em></a> as 
this will help you interpret all available information. The quilt, like a
 single chart can be displayed North Up or Course Up read more:  <a href="#Auto%20Follow%20and%20Display%20Orientation"><em>Auto Follow and Display Orientation</em></a>.<br>

<h3 id="Displaying charts"><br>
Displaying charts</h3>
OpenCPN has two modes of displaying charts, single chart mode and quilting mode.<br>
<br>
<strong>To activate</strong> <strong>chart quilting </strong>go to 
Toolbox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Chart Display Options and tick the box 
"Enable Chart Quilting",  tick the box "Show Chart Outlines" at the same
 time as this will help you see which chart mode is active. For CM93 the
 outline of individual charts can bee seen only if quilting is disabled.<br>
<br>
<strong>Full Screen Quilting</strong>. Toolbox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Disable Fullscreen Quilting. <font color="#000000"><span>By
 default all visible charts of an appropriate scale are used in the 
quilt. With this box checked only charts that overlap the center of the 
screen are used in the quilt. Checking this box is easier on the system 
and may give a performance boost in certain circumstances.</span></font><br>
<br>
<strong>Is Chart quilting on?</strong><br>
There are some visual indications on screen to confirm if quilting is on or off.
<ul>
    <li>The colored rectangles in the status bar have rounded corners 
and the white borders of the charts are invisible when quilting is on. 
When quilting is off the colored rectangles has square corners.</li>
    <li>If you have the status bar visible at he bottom of the screen "zoom + factor" to the far right, is only shown in single mode.</li>
    <li>When hovering with the mouse pointer over a inactive raster 
chart button in single chart mode, a thumbnail of the chart is displayed
 in the upper left corner of the screen. At the same time an information
 box pops up above the button with details about the chart.  This 
changes with quilting as the thumbnail is replaced with a high-lighting 
of the charts part in the quilt with a transparent reddish color.</li>
    <li>The exception to the last rule is CM93 charts. When an area is 
only covered by CM93 charts, indicated by a long yellow chart button in 
the status bar, and in quilting mode, no info-box is displayed and no 
reddish highlighting is taking place.</li>
    <li>When CM93 quilting is off, the outline of the individual cells are outlined in magenta.</li>
</ul>
<br>
More than one chart can be displayed and active at the same time, on the
 picture above, for example there are three pale blue buttons, as there 
are three raster-charts in this quilt. In single mode only one chart 
button is highlighted at a time.<br>
<br>
Depth units that is normally shown in the upper right corner of the 
display, if activated in the toolbox, is only displayed in quilting mode
 if all participating charts  uses the same unit.<br>
Zoom level, normally displayed on the far right on the Status bar, is not present in quilting.<br>
<br>
Many of these features are illustrated in this screen-dump.<br>
<br>

No depth unit is shown in the quilt as the left chart is in Feet and the
 right in Fathoms an parts thereof. Notice the lack of zoom level in the
 status bar, a quilt , by definition, consists of several different zoom
 levels.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Which charts are quilted?</strong><br>
There are several rules built into OpenCPN governing exactly how different charts reacts to the quilting mode.<br>
<strong>Raster charts</strong> and <strong>Vector charts </strong>are 
quilted separately and don't mix together. You can quilt either raster 
charts or vector charts, but not both at the same time. <br>
The exception to this rule is that CM93 ver2 charts, if available, are 
shown if no other Mercator chart cover exists for a displayed area, for 
both raster- and vector- chart quilting.<br>
Transverse Mercator Charts, which are all raster charts, are strictly 
quilted on their own. In this case, black areas can occur where there is
 no coverage.<br>
Polyconic Charts, which are all raster charts as well, are also strictly
 quilted on their own. In this case, black areas can occur where there 
is no coverage.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 ver2</strong> charts can be quilted separately.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mercator Charts</strong> are always quilted in quilting mode but don't quilt together with Transverse Mercator charts or Polyconic charts.<br>
<strong>Polyconic Charts</strong>, are quilted separately, and don't mix with Mercator or Transverse Mercator Charts<br>
<strong>Skewed Charts</strong> are allowed in the quilt as long as they don't deviate more than 5 degrees<br>
from North Up.<br>
<strong>Transverse Mercator Charts  </strong>are quilted separately from Mercator- and Polyconic- Charts.<br>
"<strong>BSB4</strong>" and "<strong>nv-charts</strong>", using plugins, quilts with other Raster Charts, following the rules above.<br>
<br>
<strong>User control</strong>.<br>
Users can control if an individual chart, is allowed in the quilt or 
not. Right clicking on any chart in a quilt and clicking "Remove this 
chart from quilt" on the pop up menu, removes the chart from the quilt. 
The chart button in the Status bar changes to <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/not_participate.png" alt="" height="20" width="60">.<br>
To activate the chart again right click this button an then click "Ad this chart to quilt"<br>

<strong>Known issues with some NOAA ENC:s </strong><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/st-croix_gray2.png" alt="" height="614" width="468"><br>
<br>
Some NOAA ENC:s are produced with "holes" in. OpenCPNs present quilt 
handling is not geared to handle this, and gray areas can under some 
circumstances be visible. The picture above is from S:t Croix in the 
Caribbean. Gray areas of three different kinds are visible.<br>
<br>
The Northern gray rectangle is an "unsurveyed" area, where, strangely 
enough, a smaller scale chart is available with a "survey". Use the 
ChartBar to switch to the smaller scale chart if necessary. Note the 
black frame.<br>
<br>
The Middle two gray rectangles are "holes" in a small scale chart, where
 larger scale charts exists. Once again use the chart bar. Tick  
Toolbox-&gt;Etc "Preserve scale when changing charts" to keep the same 
scale when switching to larger scale charts. Note that the areas are 
framed in green, indicating that larger scale charts are available.<br>
<br>
The Southern gray rectangle is a "hole" with no information available at
 all, and no other ENC charts are available. Note that there is no frame
 at all around this area.  </div>

  <h1 id="Chart Groups" class="book-heading">Chart Groups</h1>
  <br>
Chart Groups solves the following problem:  You may have manycharts  
loaded in your active database. Some of them have overlapping coverage  
at the same scale, so that when quilted the logic does not know which of
  potentially several  <br>
Another example:  Pilot charts as one Group, normal navigation charts as
 another Group, makes it possible to quickly switch between them.<br>
<br>
Final example:  in another universe, NGA charts in one group, standard NOAA RNCs in another, British UKHO in a third group.<br>
<br>
The Chart Group function allows us to define multiple Groups, with  
different chart directories in each group. The Group desired for viewing
  may be selected quickly without adding or deleting charts from the  
Active database.<br>

<br>
In Toolbox-&gt;Charts, select "Chart Groups"<br>
You will see two panes.  The left pane contains you installed ("Active")
  chart directories. The right pane allows you to create, edit, and  
delete Groups. Note that there is always a "Group 0", which is all  
"Active" charts.  This Group is not editable. New Groups which you  
create may have chart directories or individual charts added to them by 
 selecting the item in the left pane, and touching the "Add--&gt;"  
button.<br>
<br>
You may also remove individual charts and/or directories from within  
added items by selecting the desired item in the right pane, and  
touching "&lt;--Remove". Please note that "removing" an item from the  
Group does not remove it from your "Active" set.  The item is simply 
made unavailable when this Group is in use.<br>
<br>

<em>This dialog comes up when pressing the  "Chart Groups" Button.<br>
A few chart groups are defined.</em><br>
<br>

<br>
<em>In this illustration the navigator generally uses the US charts, 
when available. Coming into Baia do Porto Santo a detailed chart would 
be great, but no such US chart is available on board. A switch to the UK
 chart group solves the problem.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/group2.png" alt="" height="389" width="600"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Select the Group you want to currently use by a right-click context menu
 item called "Chart Groups". As you switch Groups the logic tries to 
select a chart and scale that closely matches the situation present 
before the switch.  As you may understand, sometimes the fit is not 
reasonable, so the resulting view may be surprising.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you have no Groups defined, as in the default installation, 
the operation of OCPN will be as in 2.5 legacy releases.  All installed 
charts are available always.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chart Groups and CM93</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/cm93grp.png" alt="" height="165" width="600"><br>
<br>
It is possible to have multiple instances of CM93v2 in different Chart 
Groups. Above we have 5 instances loaded in various chart groups. The 
view is of "All Active Charts".<br>
The instances are loaded, from left to right, in the order of the chart groups.<br>
In this situation, only the leftmost instance of CM93, that is not 
excluded from the quilt, will be displayed. Above, it is the instance 
represented by the yellow rectangle.<br>

  <h1 id="Vector Charts" class="book-heading">Vector Charts</h1>
  <p><strong>First</strong>, one very important setting for vector charts is handled directly from the main toolbar.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/text.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> This button toggles all text displayed on a vector chart On and Off.<br>
In OpenGL mode, all text will always be horizontal when using  the "Curse Up" option.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Second</strong>, double clicking on a vector chart, as long as 
the cursor has'nt changed to a green arrow near the edges, brings up an 
information dialog, displaying  the available vector-chart information 
at the selected point. Scroll down to see all the information. An 
alternative to double clicking is right-clicking an select "Object 
Query".<br>
Note that a single normal (left) click will center the chart at on that point.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/dyngnaset.png" alt="" height="556" width="451"><br>
 <br>
The example is taken from double-clicking on a lighthouse in a busy area.<br>
Exactly what is shown in this dialog depend on the settings described below in "Display Categories".<br>
<br>
<strong>Third, </strong>it is  possible to select what font is used for 
the text on vector  charts. There is an entry  in 
theToolBox-&gt;Languages/Fonts-&gt;Choose Fonts tab, called <strong>ChartTexts</strong>.
  Here you select what font-face to use, and a template size. Weight and
 final  size of the displayed texts depends on the charts you are using,
 but if  the charts contain various weights and sizes, they will all 
scale  together depending on what size you select.</p>

Navigators has the choice  of three pre-defined, different, 
presentations of ENC content, Base, Standard and Other. OpenCPN also has
 the very flexible Mariners Standard, which is better described as 
"Mariners Choice".<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Base">Base</h4>
Displays general  information, including coastline, safety-contour, isolated danger,<br>
buoy, beacon traffic separation zone, etc.<br>
<br>
From the IMO definitions:<br>
Display Base means the level of SENC information which cannot be removed from<br>
the display, consisting of information which is required at all times in
 all geographic areas and all circumstances. It is not intended to be 
sufficient for safe navigation.<br>
<h4 id="Standard"><br>
Standard</h4>
Everything in "Base" and aids to navigation, fairways, channel limits, restricted navigation zones, restricted areas, etc..<br>
<h4 id="Other"><br>
Other</h4>
Everything in "Standard" and more. This level could be described as "all essentials". More about what the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ecdis">IMO ECDIS</a>
 says about the content of these three levels. This is a good choice for
 actual, underway, navigation, avoiding the possible risks involved in 
"Mariners Standard". See more below.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Mariners Standard">Mariners Standard</h4>
Users can use  the filter tick box to set exactly what he or she wants 
displayed. A large set of filters, about 186, can be employed. They are 
all to the IHO S57 standard, and it is recommended to download <a href="http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-57Ed3.1/31ApAch1.pdf">S-57 Appendix A - IHO Object Catalog</a> and have a copy onboard. Use your pdf viewers "search" or "find" function to quickly find what an acronym means.<br>
Note that Mariners Standard gives the user a much wider choice of what 
to display, than approved ECDIS system are allowed. It is for example 
possible to not display items in the Base category.<br>

often represent an approximate location of the line of equal depth as 
related to the surveyed line delineated on the source. Also referred to 
as depth curve.<br>

<h4 id="Practical usage">Practical usage<em><br>
</em></h4>
<p id="GUID-6BCAAD17-7700-4BAD-95FA-552F311BA0FE">A general 
recommendation would be to use "Mariners Standard" and to "Select All", 
to start with, and then switch of certain features as required.</p>
As an example let's look at passing through the British gas fields in the SW North Sea<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/europe1.png" alt="" height="415" width="480"><br>
<br>
This is not easy, so we want to get rid of all those red and yellow circles.<br>
Right click on one of the platforms, square with a dot.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/query1.png" alt="" height="332" width="379"><br>
<br>
Click "Object Query", and then one of the "Light" lines in the left column.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/nsplattform.png" alt="" height="488" width="577"><br>
<br>
At the top of the right column i says "Feature Class: LIGHTS".<br>
Find "LIGHTS" in the Mariners Standard list of available filters.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/europe4.png" alt="" height="275" width="168"><br>
<br>
Untick LIGHTS.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/europe3.png" alt="" height="389" width="480"><br>
<br>
Much better!<br>
In this particular case, there is a shortcut. Use the Hot Key "S" to toggle all lights on/off.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="ShowSoundings">ShowSoundings</h4>
turns the measured depths on and of. Other settings also affects when 
soundings are displayed, for example SCAMIN. The dark black numbers are 
not soundings. Instead they refer to heights of nearby islets or cays. 
On official paper charts the soundings are printed in italics. <br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/sounding.png" alt="" height="299" width="374"><br>
<br>
The bold number 20 refers to the land height of the unnamed cay SW of the number.<br>
"Safety Depth" is set to 20 m, so all soundings greater than 20 are gray, while those less than 20 are black.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4 id="META objects">META objects</h4>
relates to information about the chart itself. With this switch on, an 
object query reveals such information as the buoyage system for the area
 and the quality of the survey.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Show Important Text Only">Show Important Text Only</h4>
displays only a bare minimum of text essential for navigation, such as 
course and bearing in a leading line (range) and bridge clearances.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Use SCAMIN">Use SCAMIN</h4>
makes sure that objects are only shown at a relevant <strong>min</strong>imum <strong>sca</strong>le. Without SCAMIN everything is always shown, leading to very cluttered view at small scale (zoomed out). <br>
<br>
<h4 id="Show ATON labels">Show ATON labels</h4>
displays names and purposes of <strong>A</strong>id <strong>To</strong> <strong>N</strong>avigation, such as number or name of buoys, information about conspicuous objects etc<br>
<h4 id="Show light description"><br>
Show light description</h4>
this tick box control display of light characteristics.  Checking this 
displays  a label with a text describing the marker or lighthouse's 
characteristics.
<h4 id="De-Clutter Text"><br>
De-Clutter Text</h4>
Even when using SCAMIN there are cases when text labels overlaps or 
overwrites other labels and creates a cluttered impression. Ticking this
 box clears up this mess. To see all the labels, increase the scale for 
the area. For Lights with many sectors, the text label for each sector 
overwrite eachother. With this box ticked only the first sector label is
 displayed. For full information regarding sector lights, do an object 
query.<br>
<h3 id="Chart display style"><br>
Chart display style</h3>
<br>
<h4 id="Points">Points</h4>
Paper chart draw the markers and lights just like the printed paper 
chart, while simplified uses icons to represent the same. Some like the 
one and some the other, a matter of taste. <br>
Paper Chart mode closely follows the IHO standard standard in this area.
 This mode is currently more developed than the simplified mode, as it 
has a higher priority in the development effort. <br>
<br>
<h4 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h4>
Plain normally just uses a dashed line, while the Symbolized version also uses triangles pointing into the area.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Colors">Colors</h4>
Depth on the chart can be displayed with either 2 or 4 colors. This 
setting is closely related to the "Depths Settings". With 2 colors, and 
using a relatively large scale, areas with depth less than "Safety 
Depth" is blue, the rest is white. With 4 colors, there are different 
colors for areas less than "Shallow Depth", areas between "Shallow 
Depth" and "Safety Depth", areas between "Safety Depth" and "Deep Depth"
 and finally for areas deeper than "Deep Depth". <br>
<br>
<h3 id=""> </h3>
<h4 id="CM93 Zoom Detail">CM93 Zoom Detail</h4>
Normal settings depend on a combination of personal preferences and 
present usage of map. To see more detail the "Zoom detail" can be set to
 a higher positive number or for navigation in shipping lanes to a 
negative numbers. Typical zoom level 5 is good for fishing when as much 
details are possible is of interest. Zoom level of +1, zero or -1 is 
usually fine for normal use.<br>
Positive values give more detail, but at a cost:<br>
a.  It simply takes longer to render larger scale charts covering more screen real estate.<br>
b.  There will be more instances of gray (NODATA) areas surrounding the 
larger scale charts as you zoom out, unless quilting is activated.<br>
c.  It can become dramatically slower if high detail is specified, and  
chart outlines are requested.  In this case, the program has to read a 
lot more  cells to get their outlines.<br>
<br>
Conversely, negative values give less detail.  Zooms are faster.<br>
<br>
In non quilting display mode, the slider can be activated through the right click meny, and displayed directly on the screen.<br>
<h3 id="Depth Settings"><br>
Depth Settings</h3>
These settings are very important as they affect how the different depths are colored.<br>
They can help you identify a deep channel for example, or they can, in  
the worst case secenario, prevent you from beeing aware of a shallow 
area.<br>
There is no setting that fits all circumstances. For example a Seamount 
with a depth of 20m  in the middle of an ocean should be regarded as 
"shallow" and be avoided, while 20 m depth in a harbor approach in 
protected water, probably is safe.<br>
<br>
The Depth Settings controls the coloring of the water as a function of 
depth. By setting the Safety and Deep water right you will have a 
visible border to show when to take care about shallow water.  <br>
CM93 charts and S57 ENCS works very similar in this area.The charts 
contains depth area features according to fixed depth cutoff zones, 
usually 5, 10, and 20 meters. Intermediate values are not available in 
the database,if you select a value between those available, opencpn 
chooses the next higher value available for display of color. <br>
The charts are inconsistent in this area, depending on the country 
issuing the original  charts. For example in UK and the Netherlands the 
depth contours in CM93 are 2, 5 and 10 meter while in Sweden they are 3,
 6 and 10 meter!<br>
Generally for both S57 ENC and CM93, find these fixed depth cutoffs by 
right clicking -&gt; Object Query -&gt;Chart -&gt; Depth Area. The two 
values DRVAL1 and DRVAL2 represents these built in cutoffs.<br>
If for example, as is the case on the South China Sea Hydrographic 
Commissions charts, the shallowest area has a   DRVAL1 = 0 m and a 
DRVAL2 = 10 m, there is, in most cases, no point in setting "Shallow 
Depth" to anything but 10 m.<br>
Find out these cut off depth for your area and set the "Depth Settings" 
with this knowledge together with your preferences and activity. <br>
<br>
Note that Shallow,Safety and Deep Depths are always in meters, even if soundings are chosen to be displayed in another unit.<br>
<br>
With all the reservations above, the general case for 4 colors, will be described.
<h4 id="Shallow Depth"><br>
<br>
Shallow Depth</h4>
will color all water areas with water depths shallower than the set depth to a dark blue color.Soundings are in black.<br>
<h4 id="Safety Depth"><br>
Safety Depth</h4>
water deeper that Shallow but shallower that this depth will have a 
paler blue color. The  Shallow Depth contour clearly marked with dark 
gray borderline.Soundings less than this depth are in black, while 
soundings greater than this value are gray.<br>
<h4 id="Deep Depth"><br>
Deep Depth</h4>
water deeper than Safety Depth but less than Deep Depth will display a 
light gray color.      The  Safety Depth contour  is clearly marked with
 black borderline. Water deeper than Deep Depth is displayed in white.<br>
<br>
<strong>Finally</strong> a word about <strong>drying heights</strong>, 
displayed in green. There is no detailed information available for the 
value of the drying heights, neither in CM93 ver2 nor in many S57 
charts, currently available for OpenCPN. Some S57 charts have negative 
DRVAL1  and  DRVAL2 = 0 m in areas with drying heights. This adds very 
little, as it really only gives the information that the drying height 
is less than DRVAL1 in an area of unspecified size. Raster charts seems 
to be the only alternative for navigation in shallow areas with a large 
tide.<br>
<br>
Hopefuly this will change.<br>
A set of new charts released in april 2012, by the Dutch Authorites, sets a standard for others to follow in this regard.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/dh.png" alt="" height="324" width="406"><br>
<br>
Compared to CM93.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/bramb1.png" alt="" height="335" width="600"><br>
<br>
When is safe to pass across Bramble Bank? The CM93 vectorchart gives us 
no information whatsoever, neither on the chart, nor in the Object Query
 dialog.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/bramb.png" alt="" height="325" width="600"><br>
<br>
While a raster chart tells us that we need a Hight of Tide that is 1.2m + safety margin + the draft of our own vessel.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/bramb2.png" alt="" height="425" width="600"><br>
<br>
Heights of islands etc. are not available in CM93, while S57 charts have
 info about heights of summits and peaks but no contour lines.<br>
Is Balls Pyramid a high Island, that the name implies, or is it named 
with the same sarcastic humor as "Greenland" ? CM93 can't tell.<br>

<span><strong>"nv-charts"</strong></span>, <strong>with chart files ending with ".eap"</strong>, are supported through  a non free plugin, for Windows only. See the <a href="http://opencpn.org/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a> D</p>
<p><strong>CM93 Version 2.</strong><br>
(C-map Version 3, and later, is in a preprocessed proprietary SENC format  and is not supported.)</p>
<p><strong>S57/S52 (ENC)</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".000". </strong><br>
OpenCPNs internal<strong> </strong>SENC files has a ".S57" file extension.<br>
<br>
If a chart is said to be a S57 Vector chart, and has a different file 
ending, it is likely to be a SENC file, a processed version of a ".000" 
chart file, in a proprietary, platform specific format, that OpenCPN 
can't handle. <br>

<p>Generally chart pictures in <strong>gif, jpeg, pdf, png, tif, bmp </strong>and other formats can be used, when properly geo-referenced, to generate<strong> kap </strong>files. For the details about this process read the <a href="#Chart%20Conversion%20Manual"><em>Chart Conversion Manual</em></a>.  Also, make sure to browse around the forum as there are a handful of  interesting chart related threads.<br>
The Zoomify image tiling format, can also <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/charts-ii-nga-2700-charts-63396.html">be converted to bsb charts.</a><br>

<p><strong>WCI</strong> charts generated with <a href="http://www.sping.com/seaclear/">SeaClear and MapCal </a>can
 also be transformed to BSB charts and used by OpenCPN. The key is to 
open a WCI chart in MapCal and then "Tools-&gt;Convert-&gt;Current WCI 
to BMP" to convert the chart to a BMP picture. More about using MapCal, a
 part of SeaClear, for chart conversions, is available here: <a href="#Conversion%20Using%20Linux"><em>Conversion Using Linux</em></a>. MapCal works just fine with Linux, using Wine.<br>
<br>
<b>OziExplorer</b><b><i> </i></b>charts consisting of picture in one of the standard formats, together with a georeferencing "<strong>.map</strong>" file, can be converted to a bsb kapfile. A Ruby script for this conversion is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/map2kap_0.1.11.rb_.zip"><strong>here</strong></a> and a more developed windows version<a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/map2kap-oziexplorer-to-opencpn-47828-10.html#post929755"><strong> here.</strong></a>
  Ozi charts of the ozfx2 or ozfx3 format can not be converted with this
 tool. These Ozi formats are not documented and proprietary, and cannot 
be displayed in OpenCPN.</p>
<p> The <strong>HDR/PCX </strong>charts, used prior to the BSB format, 
was used from the late eighties to mid nineties. While these charts 
cannot be used directly in OpenCPN, the chartpicture as such, can be 
extracted. These charts consists of many picture tiles in <strong>pcx </strong>format,
 more than 100 tiles is not unusual. The tiles can be merged to one big 
picture, and then used as any other picture, to make an OpenCPN 
compatible chart. For details on this process see the<a href="#Chart%20Conversion%20Manual"> <em>Chart Conversion Manual</em></a>  and <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/open-chart-standard-32731-4.html#post381315">this post</a> and the following posts in the forum. A script for merging the pcx tiles to one picture is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/pcx2tif.zip">here.</a></p>
<p> The HDR format is from an era when computer-memory and processing 
power were less powerful than today, as a consequence these charts are 
not of the same quality as more modern charts. Furthermore, most of 
these charts are not using WGS84 as reference datum. These charts should
 not be the first choice, but can be useful if nothing else is 
available.</p>
<h3 id="Other formats that are not supported.">Other formats that are <em>not</em> supported.</h3>
<strong>S63 Encrypted ENC charts </strong>are not supported. This is the
 format for the majority of newly produced vector charts from many 
national hydrographic offices. S63 charts are exactly the same as S57 
except the they are encrypted to keep them from being illegally 
distributed.<br>
<p>The Hydrographic Chart Raster Format, <strong>HCRF</strong>, used by 
the United Kingdom Hydrographic Offices' ARCS (Admiralty Raster Chart 
Service), Australian Hydrographic Services' Seafarer products and the NZ<em>Mariner</em>, New Zealands Official charts, are not supported.  This is also due to proprietary encryption algorithms and copyright issues.<br>
<br>
Charts from<strong> Mapmedia</strong>, <strong>Navionic</strong>, <strong>C-map</strong>(with
 the exception of CM93 version 2) and various other formats are not 
supported, for the same reasons as for the other proprietary charts.<br>

The motivation for releasing these charts is well worth reading.
    <p><cite>Realizing that official and high quality small scale ENCs 
conforming with the established IHO standard were not available for the 
SCS, the EAHC MSs decided to cooperate closely and resolve the situation
 so that mariners could use most up-to-date chart information for voyage
 planning and enhancing safety of navigation, rather than resorted to 
some commercially developed electronic products which were either 
prepared in proprietary formats, or containing unofficial data with very
 infrequent updating... It was the view that if the SCS ENC could be 
freely and widely available to mariners, it would further enhance the 
safety of navigation in the region. This in turn could reduce the 
chances of environmental damage from grounding and oil pollution, which 
have tremendous cost impact. The EAHC decided to provide the SCS ENC to 
users free of charge.</cite></p>

    <li>Clicking the <strong>Auto Follow</strong> button <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/auto-follow_0.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">
 will center the chart directly on your vessel's current location. This 
is a toggle button that is slightly larger and greyer when on. If the

If zoomed out to a scal that is smaller than 1:300.000 the icons changes to <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/own5.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="30" width="31">, when receiving gps signals and <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/own4.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="31" width="30"> otherwise. More about he OwnShip icon is available in  <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/marks_and_routes#ownship"><em>Marks and Routes</em>.</a></li>
    <li>The default own ship icon can be replaced by  putting a file 
"ownship.xpm" in the User icons shared data directory. More about this  
shared directory here: <a href="#Marks%20and%20Routes"><em>Marks and Routes</em></a></li>
    <li>The Auto Follow button useful for two different situations:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>When you have panned the map away from your current location and want to quickly move back to your vessel.</li>
    <li>When underway, this will keep the display on the chart around your vessel, with the boat at the center of the chart.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Note: Panning the chart will disable this mode. Simply click <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/auto-follow_0.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> again to turn <strong>Auto Follow</strong> mode back on.</li>
    <li>The display can be oriented three different ways, normally it is <strong>North Up</strong> but  <strong>Course Up</strong>
 is an alternative. With Course Up OpenCPN uses COG, course over ground.
 The easiest way to change between these two modes is through the "Right
 Click" menu. One situation where course up might be considered is when 
navigating a river or a canal. The third orientation is when skew charts
 are displayed, they are simply shown as "<strong>Chart Up</strong>",  but an optional setting exist to show them as "North Up".</li>
    <li>In the picture below the Course Up is active. COG is 41Deg. 
Notice how all text on the vector chart, is aligned correctly. This only
 works in OpenGL mode. The red arrow, in the upper right corner, is 
always pointing North.</li>
</ul>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/course-up.png" alt="" height="605" width="800"><br>

    <li><span>If the option "Show skewed raster charts as North-up" in the  Settings tab,  is <strong>not</strong>
 ticked, the right-click toggle option "Set Course  Up  Mode/Set North 
Up Mode" will be replaced by "Set Course Up/Set Chart Up", for skewed 
charts.</span></li>
    <li>If an electronic compass is available in the NMEA stream the own
 ship icon will be orientated according to this heading. The difference 
can be seen on the chart if there is a cross current, for example.  The 
boat below is heading WNW but is being set SW. An AIS CPA, Closest Point
 of Approach is also visible.    </li>

 mode. These settings are toggled in the rightclick menu, but can also 
be controlled in the ToolBox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Chart Display Options 
-&gt;Course Up Mode</li>
    <li>Note that both the red and the blue arrows are <strong>always</strong> pointing North.</li>
    <li><strong>Look Ahead!</strong> To see more of the chart in front 
of the boat, activate ToolBox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Chart Display Options
 -&gt;Look Ahead  Mode. Your own boat will no longer be in the center of
 the screen. Instead it will be located away from the center, in the 
opposite direction to your present gps course(COG).</li>
    <li><strong>Don't always Look Ahead!</strong> If you are at anchor, 
swinging on the hook produces random courses and low speeds.If Look 
Ahead is on in this situation  the chart rendering will constantly be 
redrawn, with the boat in all possible lookahead positions as the course
 changes. To prevent this kind of scenario OpenCPN works like this:<br>
    *If the boat speed is less than 1 kt, then lookahead is disabled.<br>
    *If boat speed is greater than 3 kts, lookahead is enabled.<br>
    *In between 1 and 3 kts, the lookahead "distance" is adjusted smoothly.<br>
    *If  the problems still there when doing more than 3 kts, consider 
using  "ToolBox-&gt;GPS-FilterNMEA Course and Speed data"  to average 
out the "jumpiness".</li>
    <li><strong>Show skewed raster charts as North-up</strong>. Skewed 
charts are normally showed "chart up", as intended by design. If ticking
 this box, these charts are shown North-Up. In both cases, activating 
course up, works as expected, the difference is when course up is <strong>n</strong><strong>ot</strong> on.</li>

<h5 id="Creating a mark">Creating a mark</h5>
There are a few ways to directly create marks.
<ul>
    <li>Pressing "Enter" or "Space" creates a mark at the boats position.</li>
    <li>"Ctrl + M" creates a mark at the cursor position.</li>
    <li>Rightclick and and press "Drop Mark Here" creates a mark at the position of the cursor when clicking.</li>
    <li>Marks are created at the start of each leg in a route, and one 
at the end of the route. More about routes a bit further down this page.</li>
</ul>
Marks created these ways will have a triangular icon, except for routes that uses a diamond, but no name. <br>
<br>
The default icon, when creating a mark, is settable by changing the the value <b>"DefaultWPIcon"</b> in the opencpn.ini(config) file. Use the name of any available icon in the properties dialog. <br>

<p>You can move the mark by left-click-dragging it around.</p>
<p>You can delete a mark  by right-clicking its icon, and selecting  "Delete Mark".<br>
All marks have properties that can be seen by rightclicking and pressing "Mark/WP Properties". <br>
<strong>Read all about the properties dialog in </strong><a href="#Extended%20Marks"><em><strong>Extended Marks</strong></em></a><br>
Marks can be manipulated through the Route Managers Waypoints tab as 
well. Deleting a mark that is part of a route, will also change  the 
route.Marks that are a part of a "layer" cannot be changed at all. Marks
 can also be imported into OpenCPN in a number of ways.<br>

<h3 id="Use your own Icons">Use your own Icons</h3>
OpenCPN comes with a handful of different icons that can be assigned to a
  mark. Right click or use the Route Manager and activate the properties
  dialog. The Mark Icon window in the dialog shows the available icons. 
 <br>
<br>
A user can install his or her own icons to use with marks and "own ship".<br>
<br>
1. Create a directory called "UserIcons" in the same place that holds 
your opencpn.ini(config) file. Instructions to find the directory 
(folder) location here:<a href="#Installing%20OpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a><br>
<br>
2.  Add .xpm files to this directory.  They can be any size.  The name  
 embedded within the xpm file becomes the name of the new waypoint icon.
    These new icons will appear on the Waypoint Properties dialog, and 
can   be assigned to any waypoint.  They can also be assigned in GPX 
Import   files.<br>
<br>
3. The <a href="http://opencpn.org/drupal/user_icons">User Icons</a> page contains links to a few sets of user contributed icons.<br>
<br>
<a name="#"></a>4.To replace the default own ship icon <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ship_red_002.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19"> , just  put a file "ownship.xpm", containing the ownship picture you prefer, in the UserIcons directory, described above. <br>
<br>
<h5 id="Size of Own Ship Icon and location of the GPS antenna.">Size of Own Ship Icon and location of the GPS antenna.</h5>
The size of  the ownship icon is adjustable through the config file. Add these lines under the "[Settings]" header:<br>
OwnshipLengthMeters=nn<br>
OwnshipBeamMeters=mm<br>
OwnshipGPSOffsetY=yy<br>
OwnshipGPSOffsetX=xx<br>
OwnshipMinMM=kk<br>
<br>
The <strong>Ownship rendering logic</strong>, using the built in icon, is :<br>
1.  Default:  If no value is specified for OwnshipMinMM , the built-in 
yacht icon will be used, and no ownship scaling is performed.<br>
2.  If OwnshipMinMM=kk is specified, the built-in yacht icon will be 
used, and scaled as though it represented a vessel 12 Metres long, 
scaled up or down according to the display chart zoom factor.  However, 
the minimum size will not be less than (kk) mm. In no case will ship 
icon be smaller than 1 mm on screen.<br>
 3. If both OwnshipMinMM=kk and OwnshipLengthMeters=nn are specified, 
then the built-in yacht icon is scaled according to the chart zoom 
factor, calculated as though it represented a vessel of length (nn) 
metres.<br>
 4. If,  in addition to Rule 3,  OwnshipBeamMeters=mm is specified, then
 the built-in generic ship icon is used, scaled accordingly.<br>
 5. If you installed your own ownship.xpm icon, then Rule 3 applies. It 
is assumed that the ownship icon closely fits the bounding box of the 
graphic in the length dimension. OwnshipBeamMeters must be omitted or 
zero<br>
6.  If canvas scale is larger than 1:300,000, then the ship icon is  
rendered  as a red or grey target, according to IHO recommendation.<br>
7.  GPS antenna location offsets may be specified by OwnshipGPSOffsetY=yy and OwnshipGPSOffsetX=xx.<br>
Y offset is from bow, measured in meters.  Default is one half ownship length.<br>
X offset is from ship centerline, positive values to starboard. Default is zero.<br>
<br>

Routes</h3>
<p>Press the <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/route.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"> -button and start  the creation of a route.  When clicked the cursor changes to a  (<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/pencil2.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="16" width="31">
 ) pencil when you moce off the button. Left click along the desired 
route you want to make. This will leave sequential numbered waypoints as
 you click along, the numbers will not be visible, but are available in 
the Route Properties Dialog, accessible through the right click menu or 
the Route Manager. The running total distance of the whole route will be
 shown along the "pencil" together with the course from the last marked 
waypoint. When creating routes, OpenCPN will ask if it should use a 
nearby mark, when a route point is added that is close to an already 
existing mark.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/route_new.png" alt="" height="330" width="600"><br>
<br>
If your desired route extends off the currently displayed chart, move 
the route cursor in the desired direction and the display will 
automatically pan to show the area.  You can zoom in and out with the 
mouse scroll wheel or keyboard +/- keys during route creating.  You can 
also right click and select 'MAX DETAIL HERE' or 'Scale Out' during 
route creation. When finished right click and choose end route from the 
context menu, alternatively just press the "Esc" key.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/context.png" alt="" align="textTop" height="140" width="174"></p>
<p>The right click menu is context sensitive, exactly what you get 
depend on what sort of chart it is and if quilting is activated, for 
example.<br>
You should now have an inactive (Blue) route.  Active routes are Red, inactivated routes are Blue.<br>
Right clicking on a route brings up a menu with many alternatives, such as "Insert Waypoint" and "Append Waypoint".</p>
<h3 id="Multiple Routes">Multiple Routes </h3>
<p>In OpenCPN multiple routes can be handled in a couple of different ways.<br>
Many routes can be created in a session or imported into a session.<br>
The visibility of every route is controlled in the Route Manager. There 
is an "eye" to the far left on the line for each route. This works as a 
toggle switch.<br>
This way only the route(s) of interest for the moment can be shown.<br>
<br>
Another way is to create and export routes, and later import them when needed.<br>
To keep the chart clear of useful but un-needed routes follow these steps: <br>
• Create a folder called, 'GPX_Routes', or another suitable name.<br>
• Create your route. <br>
• Use the Route Manager to export the route, with a descriptive file name and save it in GPX_Routes.<br>
• Delete the route from the chart.<br>
• You can export all your routes as one big file or export and delete a route as you create them<br>
• When needed, simply use the Route Managers "Import" Button to open the route file. <br>
 </p>
<p>To get rid of the way points left on the chart when a route has been 
imported and then deleted, which may happen depending on the imported 
gpx file.</p>
<p>1. Open the Route Managers Waypoint tab and press the "Delete All" button<br>
2. Say 'Yes' to: 'Are you sure you want to delete &lt;ALL&gt; waypoints?'</p>
<h3 id="Saving and Loading Routes and Marks">Saving and Loading Routes and Marks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Refer to <a href="#The%20Route%20Manager%20and%20Gpx%20Data"><em>The Route Manager and Gpx Data</em></a> to load and save data using The Route Manager</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Activating and using routes">Activating and using routes</h3>
Right clicking on the track, changes the color from blue to orange and brings up a comprehensive menu. <br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/route-info1.png" alt="" height="578" width="750"> <br>
<br>
Clicking "Activate Route" or performing the same action through the 
Route Manager, changes the route color to red and new, route information

Drop a Man Over Board Marker at your present position by pressing<br>
<strong>* Man Over Board Button</strong> <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/mob_btn.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="32" width="32">  on the ToolBar <br>
or hit the<strong> </strong>Keys<strong> <br>
*Ctrl + Space bar</strong>. <br>
<br>
A mark, looking like the button is instantly created - the MOB mark.<br>
The MOB mark will be called "MAN OVERBOARD at + time-stamp"<br>
<br>
A temporary route, <strong>from </strong>a point 1 mile ahead on the current COG, and <strong>to </strong>the
 MOB mark is created and activated. On the screen, a course and bearing 
to the MOB mark will be displayed. This temporary triangular mark is 
labeled "1.0 NM along COG".<br>
<br>
If COG, course over ground, is not available, no route is created but 
the MOB position is marked. This can happen if no GPS is connected, if 
the GPS signal is (temporary) unavailable or if the speed is so low that
 the GPS doesn't calculate COG.<br>
<br>
<strong>To delete a MOB</strong><br>
The temporary route can be deleted, through the right-click menu, but no
 action of the user with the mouse or keyboard will move or delete the 
MOB mark, except for a right click -&gt; Mark/Wpt Properties and <strong>select a different icon</strong>,
 and then delete the mark (ex mob mark) from the right click menu, or 
through the Route Manager.  A MOB mark is not included in "Delete All" 
in the Toute Manager, to avoid mistakes. The mark has to be selected 
alone and then "Deleted". <br>
<br>
Multiple MOB marks can be deployed, and multiple temporary routes will 
be created. The active route will always be associated with the last 
dropped MOB mark.<br>
<br>
Be very careful when using this capability in waters with strong tide or current.<br>
The person overboard will <strong>not</strong> be at the position of the
 MOB mark for long. Both Own Boat and the person in the water will move 
with the current, but OpenCPN knows nothing about this.<br>

<br>
<strong>NMEA Data Source:</strong> Set the source for your GPS 
connection. Note that you can write in this field. For example to get 
"Gippy" to work with OpenCPN, this is where you write the path to the 
virtual GPS created by Gippy. Similar, if you know that the GPS is on 
COM3, but this port does not show up in the list, just write "COM3" in 
the field.<br>
<br>
<strong>Details for windows.</strong><br>
Due to performance reason OpenCPN by default only accepts COM ports up 
to 32. If this is not enough, OpenCPN will accept ports up to 42 with 
the following line added to the opencpn.ini configuration file:<br>
<span><span><em>[Settings]<br>
WindowsComPortMax=42</em></span></span><br>
In the tab select  the 'NMEA Data Source' from the choices shown in the 
drop-down box, and  choose the port to which your GPS is connected. If 
you are using a standard serial port, then choose  the proper physical 
port number to match. If, on the other hand, you are  using a USB GPS, 
then you will select the virtual serial port which was  created by your 
GPS device driver. You may need to try several  selections to find the 
correct port.   For XP/Vista: Using the  Device Manager, look for a 
serial port which appears and disappears  dynamically as you plug and 
unplug the USB GPS cable. This is your  virtual GPS serial port. When 
the properly configured GPS is connected,  powered up, and recognized, 
and a show a green <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/gpsGrn.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="28" width="28"> icon or gps status icon <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/gps2.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="28" width="28">
 in the right end of the tool-bar.   OpenCPN  automatically configures  
bits, parity, etc. These do not  need to be separately specified.<br>
<br>
<strong>Details for Linux.</strong> Connect directly to one of the 
available physical ports, or use gpsd. For gpsd versions earlier than 
2.9, select "Network GPSD" else select "Network LIBGPS". For Ubuntu 10.4
 and later select "Network LIBGPS".<br>
<br>
<strong>GPSD Data Server:</strong> is normally "localhost", but it's 
possible to have one gpsd server on a local network with many OpenCPN 
clients. In this case, specify the network address of the gpsd server. 
With OpenCPN it's possible to connect even a <strong>Windows</strong> instance, to a gpsd server this way.<br>
<br>
<strong>NMEA Baude Rate:</strong> 4800 is the normal value for many devices, but some newer gps receivers require a different value. Check your documentation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use Garmin</strong> <strong>GRMN/GRMN(Host) mode for Waypoint and Route  uploads</strong>.
 Make sure that  this box is ticked, if you have a Garmin GPS. The 
reason for this is that Garmin units cannot accept route uploads via 
standard NMEA0183.  This is a "design feature" of all Garmin receivers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show GPS/NMEA data stream window:</strong> If you  check this box you will get a window that shows the NMEA data sentences  coming into OpenCPN.<br>
If gpsd is used on Linux, no data will be shown.<br>
For  simple NMEA data stream debugging, add the following to your opencpn.ini  file:Under  [Settings] add a line <br>
<em>DebugNMEA=1500</em><br>
This will provide up  to 1500 debug messages pertaining to NMEA traffic to the opencpn.log <br>
<br>
<strong>Filter NMEA Course and Speed Data:</strong> Providing a rolling 
average of COG/SOG, with configurable sampling period. This feature is 
useful, for example, if you find that course and speed from the gps is 
varying erratically due to the sea state. The Dashboard plugin is not 
affected by this setting  - COG and SOG are updated about once per 
second.<br>
<br>
<strong>Course-Up Mode Display Update Period:</strong> This relates to 
how often the entire displayed chart is updated.  The own-ship and AIS 
icons are still updated every second. The default value is 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
<strong>Autopilot Output Port:</strong> Connect any NMEA  0183 
compatible autopilot. Select the correct serial port from the list. 
OpenCPN does accept autopilot output on the main GPS input port, using 
the same baud rate, unless it is set to "<span>AIS Port (Shared)"</span>.<br>
If you need the NMEA RMC sentence output on your autopilot port, add the
 following in the opencpn.ini file, called opencpn.conf in Linux:<br>
..........<br>
[Settings]<br>
AutoPilot NMEA Sentence Out=RMB;RMC<br>
..........<br>
Default is RMB only, and works for most autopilots.<br>
Most users will not need this config entry.<br>

<br>
<strong><a name="#"></a>Automatic Daily Tracks</strong>.     <br>
Automatic Daily Tracking ensures that the track-points collected 
throughout a single day (midnight to midnight in local zone time) are 
stored and managed as a single (possibly multi-segment) track.<br>
If the Automatic Daily Tracking check-box is selected, the "Toggle 
Tracking" tool will - as before - turn tracking on and off. However, on 
turning it off, the accumulated track will be extended with the previous
 one, if it does not extend into yesterday. Disjoint segments are kept 
separate, time-adjacent segments are merged into a single segment.<br>
Every Midnight the tracking is turned off and on again automatically, to ensure that the track does not span dates.<br>
If Automatic Daily Tracking is selected during the day, when some tracks
 have already been created, only the last one will be merged with future
 daily tracks.<br>
Assuming Automatic Daily Tracking is on, normally during tracking 
periods there will be two tracks visible in the Route Manager: the 
current track (red color track-points on the chart) and the previously 
accumulated track for the day. After toggling tracking off there will be
 just one track for this day.<br>
If the timezone needs to be changed, it is a good idea to close OpenCPN application before..<br>
With the manual capability of splitting and extending, the daily tracks can be easily managed at any time.<br>
The daily tracks will be automatically named with the date in the local Time Zone, but can of course be changed manually<br>
Without Automatic Daily Tracking selected, OpenCPN handles tracks as before.<br>
<br>
<strong>Highlight Tracks</strong>  shows a 10m wide highlighting, either
 side of the track. This is not selectable for individual tracks. The 
idea of the highlighting was to remind us that following a previous 
track exposes us to the inherent inaccuracy of GPS, and that the real 
track followed is most likely within the highlight region, but not 
necessarily in the middle. And this says nothing about the accuracy of 
the underlying cartography. For many charts it is prudent to assume at 
least 1.5 mm inaccuracy using the nominal scale of the chart. For a 
chart in scale 1:20,000 this translates to 30m.<br>

<br>
<strong>Place Track-points</strong> at either time or distance interval.
 This affects the size of the data saved to keep the track visible. It 
also affects the "smoothness" of the track.<br>
<br>
<strong>Radar rings:</strong> These show up as red rings centered on  
your gps position, and can be useful in different circumstances, such as
  keeping clear of dangers. The settings are, hopefully, intuitive.<br>
<br>
<strong>Waypoint locking</strong>. Locks waypoints, and prevents accidental moving of them. This box should normally be ticked  when under way.<br>
<br>
<strong>GUI Options</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Enable wheel-zoom-to-cursor</strong>: Normally when clicking on 
 the screen, the display centers on the clicked point. The wheel zooms  
in/out always using the center of the display. With this box ticked,   
the zooming happens at the point of the cursor. This means that as soon 
 as you start to zoom in the cursor stay in the same place on the screen
 and on approximately the same geographical position. The advantage is 
that the zooming in position can be fine tuned just using the cursor. <br>
Toolbox-&gt;Settings-&gt;<span>Enable Smooth Panning/Zooming</span>  will be completely disabled if ZoomToCursor is enabled.<br>
<br>
<strong>Preserve scale when switching charts:</strong>  Normally when  
switching charts OpenCPN will open the new chart scaled close to it's  
natural scale, the zoom factor stays the same. With this box ticked  
OpenCPN will keep the scale from the last chart, when switching, not  
exactly, but generally of the same magnitude. The zoom-factor will  
increase as you switches to smaller scale charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Play ship bells:</strong> Every half-hour the traditional ship bell will  be heard. <br>
<br>
<strong>Show toolbar in fullscreen mode:</strong> The key F11 toggles fullscreen mode on/off. <br>
<br>
<strong>Enable transparent toolbar:</strong> On Linux it is necessary to
  activate a window manager compositing system, such as Compiz or GNOME 
 Shell, to have a transparent toolbar.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show layers initially</strong>:Layers that are saved in a 
directory called "layers", in the same place that holds your 
opencpn.ini(config) file(Windows) or /home/$USER/.opencpn/layers(Linux),
 are automatically  loaded on start of OpenCPN. Any subdirectories in 
the layers directory,  are also loaded.<br>
To actually display the loaded layers on startup, tick this box. Further
 adjustment to visibility is possible in the Route Managers Layer Tab.<br>

Use the F6 key for dimming and SHIFT + F6 to reverse the dimming.<br>
This is not connected to a chart feature, and dims the whole display, not just OpenCPN.<br>
"CTRL + G" cycles through (monochromatic) green, red and normal screen. The color  change applies to the whole screen as well.<br>
"Ctrl + G" may not work on some Windows systems, depending upon the graphics driver implemented.<br>
 <br>
When pressing F6 the word "MAX" appears on the screen in the NW part.  
Press again and the screen gets a bit dimmer and "MAX" is replaced by a 
 "9" and so on.<br>

This Button <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/colscheme.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> has 4 levels corresponding to standard US raster charts built in levels.<br>
These represents the Default level, the Daylight level, the Dawn or Dusk
 level and finally the Night level. Generally there is no difference 
between the Default level and the Daylight level.<br>
<br>
The way this button works differs between different category of charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>S57 Vector Charts and the CM93 ver2 charts.</strong><br>
All charts display the Dawn/Dusk and Night levels. This means that there
 is no change when the button is first pressed, but further pressing 
brings up a Dusk and then a Night palette.<br>
<strong>US Raster Charts</strong><br>
These works the same as the vector-charts.<br>
<strong>Other Raster Charts</strong><br>
Most other raster charts just contains a standard palette, and pressing 
the Button has no effect other than dimming part of OpenCPN, except for 
the chart display.<br>
The Brazilian Raster Charts includes a dusk and night palette, but the colors displayed is not what one would expect.<br>
Charts converted with the help of libbsb,tiff2bsb and imgkap, normally only contains the standard color scheme for daylight.<br>

  Let's take a look at some of OpenCPN's advanced features.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>  <div id="node-26" class="section-3">
  <h1 id="AIS" class="book-heading">AIS</h1>
  <p>For a general introduction to AIS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System">Wikipedia</a> is a good place to start.<br>
The screendump below gives you a first feel for how AIS targets are presented and used in OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais-3.png" alt="" height="640" width="800"><br>
<br>
<em>The Lookahead mode is activated here and our own vessel is 
proceeding 352 deg at 13.8 kts, leaving an activated track behind, and 
projecting a dashed line ahead representing the course. This ends in a 
dot, that represents where we will be in 6 minutes, or 1.38 nautical 
miles ahead. We are meeting a vessel, steaming in the opposite direction
 following the traffic separation. This target also has a line and a dot
 in-front of it representing course and where it will be in 6 
minutes(user configurable), and a track behind it.. The two blue dots 
with a red/yellow line between them, represents where the vessels will 
be at CPA - closest point of approach, or when the are nearest each 
other, with present courses and speeds.</em><em> The meeting vessel is red, as it is a potential danger to us.</em> <em>An AIS target alert dialog has just popped up.</em><br>
<br>
There is a lot of information about the vessels that transmits AIS signals.<br>
 </p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais11.png" alt="" height="452" width="368"></p>
<p><br>
<em>The cursor is on top of the the meeting vessel on a SW course. As we
 have not yet received full information, this can take a while, we don't
 get the name but an id number, the so called MMSI number, instead. 
Exactly what is shown in the yellow popup is configured in the AIS tabs 
Rollover heading.<br>
<br>
</em></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais2.png" alt="" height="308" width="356"></p>
<p><br>
<em>This vessel is identified by name, and has a green color, as it does not represent any danger to our navigation.<br>
<br>
</em></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais-query1.png" alt="" height="447" width="350"><br>
 </p>
<p class="rteleft"><em>If we instead of just hovering the cursor on an 
object, right click, the menu item AIS Target Query brings up the dialog
 above. The same dialog comes up by simply doubble clicking the AIS 
target. A lot of relevant information is displayed. TCPA is the time 
until CPA, how long before we are at the closest point to the other 
vessel.</em><br>
<br>
<em><br>
</em></p>
<h3 id="The AIS Target List">The AIS Target List</h3>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/aisinfo.png" alt="" height="443" width="750"><br>
Another way to present the AIS information. The AIS target list is 
available through the right click menu.  Click on the header in a column
 to sort according to this criteria. For example, clicking "Range" sorts
 the targets with the nearest target on top. Click one more time to get 
the target, furthest away on top.<br>
Active Search And Rescue Target (<strong>SART</strong>) and Digital Selective Calling (<strong>DSC</strong>) distress targets, will always stay at the top of the list, even when sorting. <br>
AIS targets  with Lat &gt; +/-85 deg will show brg "unavailable". OpenCPn is not suited for Polar Navigation.<br>
<strong>Target Info</strong><em> </em>button<em>: </em>Click on a target to highlight it and then click the button  to display the information dialog.<br>
<strong>Jump To</strong> button: Highlight a target an click this button and the screen will center on the target.<br>
<strong>Limit Range</strong>: The list will only show targets with a range less than, or equal to this value.  <br>
<strong>Target Count:</strong> Total number of AIS targets.<br>

<h3 id="The ToolBox AIS Tab">The ToolBox AIS Tab</h3>
<br>
<div class="rteleft"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/toolbox-ais1.png" alt="" height="743" width="660"></div>
<p class="rtecenter"> </p>
<p class="rteleft">This tab controls the behavior of many thing in the 
AIS display. There are no "best" settings. It all depend on where you 
are, what kind of navigation you are into and what kind of vessel you 
are on. It is your responsibility to evaluate this.<br>
<br>
<strong>AIS data port</strong>: Select your AIS input port on your 
computer. When this is set to anything but "None", the AIS button 
appears in the ToolBar. This button appears different according to the 
following conditions.<br>
 </p>
<p class="rteleft"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Alive. The default AIS button. This icon appears as soon as an AIS 
port is active in the tool-box. It is also the normal state with an AIS 
receiver working and with no targets of interest.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais_alive_active.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">AIS
  Alive and Activity, a small green circle will illuminate in the lower 
right  corner of the Ais buton. If there is at least one AIS message 
every 4 seconds, the light will remain illuminated.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais_supressed.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Suppressed. This icon indicates only that target suppression is 
activated in the AIS tab in the ToolBox. Referring to the picture above 
there are two sort of suppression: <br>
* Suppress display of all moored/anchored targets, max speed specified in dialog.<br>
* Suppress Alerts for moored/anchored targets.<br>
This icon will be over-ridden with the AIS alarm button if an alarm is, 
or becomes, active according to the AIS tab alarms  settings in the 
toolbox.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais_alarm.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Alarm. A target exist that raises the alarm as defined in the AIS 
tab in the ToolBox. It is the three settings "CPA Calculations", that 
rules if and when an alarm is raised.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais_disabled.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Disabled. No targets, if available, are shown on the screen. This 
button toggles  with the other buttons. For example, if the AIS alarm 
button is visible, click the button and it will change to the "AIS 
Disabled" button, and all targets, alarms etc, disappears from the 
display. Click again and the original button and AIS display comes back.<br>
<br>
<strong>CPA calculation</strong>: Rules for how and when the Closest 
Point of Approach- CPA (when two vessels are nearest each other) is 
calculated. There are three tick boxes, which can be activated with user
 set values.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> If the vessel is far away it is less interesting to 
calculate CPA. In a busy waterway this could cut down on clutter and 
processing speed if a reasonable value is set.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Similar arguments to No 1. This controls when a warning for minimum CPA distance is given.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Similar to No 2 this controls the alarm based on a 
minimum time to CPA. A target is regarded as lost if regular 
transmissions is not received, updating the vessels status.<br>
<br>
<strong>Lost Targets:</strong> Rules for how lost targets should be handled on the display. <br>
<strong>1.</strong> Target is regarded as lost if no transmission are 
received for the number of minutes set here, the target will change on 
the display and have a black bar across.<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais-lost.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="51" width="51"><br>
<strong>2.</strong> The lost target will be removed from the display after the number of minutes set here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Display:</strong> If and how a vessels course and speed should be displayed and if stationary vessels should be on the screen.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> An arrow will be shown in front of the vessel 
representing it's COG (Course Over Ground). The length of this arrow and
 the dot at the end of it represents the calculated position in the 
number of minutes set here. Set easily calculated values. If a vessel 
approaches you doing 15 kts and the time is set to 6 minutes, the dot 
will be 1.5 nautical miles ahead of the vessel.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> A track will be shown behind a target. This helps to judge the target vessels intentions.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/trail.png" alt="" height="213" width="600"><br>
<strong><br>
3.</strong> An anchored or moored target <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/ais-moor.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="50" width="50">
  will not be displayed if the speed is less than the value set here. 
This "avigational Staus" is set by the ships and may not be correct.<br>
<strong>4.</strong> Show Area Notices. More about <a href="#AIS%20Area%20Messages"><em>AIS Area Messages</em></a> here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rollover:</strong> Tick the boxes for the kind of information 
shown when hovering with the cursor over a target. This is what you get 
with all the settings  ticked.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/rollover.png" alt="" height="214" width="466"></p>
<p class="rteleft"><br>
<strong>CPA/TCPA Alerts:</strong> When an alert is triggered, a jagged 
circle in red is drawn around the target that set off the alarm. 
Additional events can be set here, drawing more attention to the alarm. 
For practical navigation, make sure your alarm sound is set.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> Shows an alert dialog on the screen with target information when an alarm is triggered.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Sounds an alarm when an alarm is triggered.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Don't show alarms for anchored and moored targets.<br>
<br>
<strong>Select Alert Sound.</strong> Select an alarm that suits you. 
This alarm will also be used if an anchor watch is set. Due to copyright
 issues, only a few sound files are included. Users can add their own 
generic ".wav" sound files. The location for these files are  
"/usr/local/share/opencpn/sounds/" on Linux and typically C:\Program 
Files\OpenCPN\sounds on Windows XP.<br>
<strong>Test Alert Sound.</strong> Test the selected sound and make sure this important feature is working<br>
<br>
<strong>Enable Target Alert Acknowledge timeout</strong>. Once a target alert is acknowledged, wait the set number of minutes before the alert comes up again (if still applicable).</p>
<p class="rteleft">.</p>
<h3 id="When exactly is an alarm activated?"><br>
<strong>When exactly is an alarm activated?</strong></h3>
<p class="rteleft">An alert is set off if your boat is approaching the 
CPA, the blue dot on  the extension of the course line, and the 
previously discussed set of  conditions are met. Once the distance to 
the CPA increases, this happens  when the involved vessels has passed 
each other, the alarm stops,  even if the other conditions still apply. </p>

  <em>The US FCC has recently approved transmissions by AIS SART 
devices.   These devices were originally designed for SOLAS class ships 
as an  alternative to radar SARTs for carriage on life boats, but the  
efficiency of design has encouraged applications down to man-over-board 
 devices</em>. (<a href="http://www.exactearth.com/media-centre/exactblog/">www.exactearth.com/media-centre/exactblog</a>,<span><span>May 3, 2012</span></span>)<br>
<br>
Search And Rescue Transponders (SART) or an EPIRB, transmitting AIS 
messages are now available on the market. In an emergency situation the 
position  will be displayed as an AIS target in  OpenCPN. AIS SART can 
be a device on a vessel, in a life raft or a personal Man Over Board 
(MOB) device. The common thing is that the icon below marks an <strong>emergency</strong>.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/SART4.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="41" width="45"> SART icon, <strong>distress</strong> target display. <strong>This is a "Mayday".</strong><br>
<br>
On OpenCPN a distress signal sent by a  SART, triggers an visual alert 
and a warning sound, if this is activated in the ToolBox--&gt;AIS Tab.  
 <br>
<br>

For the basics of marks se this page:  <a href="#Marks%20and%20Routes"><em>Marks and Routes </em></a><br>
<br>
The properties of Extended marks described on this page expands the use of marks.<br>
It is now possible, for example, to make a interactive Cruising Pilot.<br>
An extended mark is sometimes called a <strong>POI</strong>, a point of interest.<br>
<br>
The "Mark/WP Properties" looks like this for a default mark.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/mark5.png" alt="" height="489" width="500"><br>
<br>
The dialog is available in the rightclick menu or through the Route Manager.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Basic tab.</strong><br>
<strong>Name</strong>: Give the mark a suitable name. This will be visible on the chart, but can be hidden by un-ticking the <strong>Show Name</strong> box.<br>
<strong>Icon</strong>: Change the default icon for the mark. Only the "Name" will be displayed if selecting the "Empty" icon.<br>
<strong>The position of the mark</strong>: You can drag the mark with the mouse to the desired position or enter the correct <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> in these fields.<br>
<strong>Description</strong>: Enter anything about the mark. Long descriptions can be read easier by switching to the <strong>Description Tab</strong>. See examples below.<br>
<br>

<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/mark3.png" alt="" height="489" width="500"><br>
<br>
<strong>Links</strong>: Marks can, as an option, have embedded links to 
the Internet or the the local computer.  These are either opened in the 
default browser or through the default application, for example for 
pictures or pdf files.<br>
For security reasons, the links does not work for launching other programs.<br>
<br>
Create a link by pressing <strong>Add</strong>. Give the link a good description in the new dialog. <br>
Enter an Internet adress in <strong>URL</strong> or find a local file through the button <strong>Local File..</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/mark8.png" alt="" height="489" width="500"><br>
<br>
The new link will appear under <strong>Links</strong>. Add more links as required.<br>
<strong>Edit</strong> links by pressing the "Edit" button. The 
description will change from "Links are opened in the default browser." 
to " Links are opened for editing" when the button is pressed. The color
 of the "Edit" button gets a greyer shade when it is pressed down. Press
 once more to release the button. Press once - the button is down. Press
 again - the button is released and goes up.<br>

    <li><em>Departure Time</em>:With no departure time the ETE 
(Estimated Time Enroute) is calculated. Enter a Departure Time and the 
ETA will be calculated. Make sure to press "Enter/Return" after entering
 a dearture time. This guarantees that the entered time is used in 
calculations.</li>
    <li><em>Times shown as</em>: UTC is a new name for GMT. LMT is a 
local mean  time based on the present longitude. For Local Zone Time one
 can also  enter the keyword "now".</li>

 in the Properties Dialog also marks the Waypoint on the chart with a 
blue square.<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/bluesquare.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="38" width="40"></li>
    <li><em>Extend Route</em>:Extending is possible only when it is 
obvious, what should be joined  with the current route (current = 
visible in the Dialog). Eligible are  all visible route points shared 
with, or lying nearby to the current  route's endpoint. If there is 
exactly 1 such point, then it is  considered obvious, and the Extend 
button is enabled. If there are more,  some should be hidden before 
proceeding, until just 1 remains.<br>
    Routes are extended <em> forward</em>, based on the geographic 
location, next  route point must be very near, as when mouse-extending 
the route. If the next route point is to far away for extending, just 
create the joining leg and extend twice.</li>
    <li><em>Split Route</em>:For splitting, the split point is selected 
as the row in the listing.  The point-of-split becomes part of both new 
routes (shared) or tracks  (cloned). Original route/track is deleted.</li>
    <li>Here is a basic example of first splitting then extending. The test route is shown below</li>
    <li><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/orig.png" alt="" height="455" width="421">"Split Test_A"</li>
    <li>In the Route Managers property dialog for the route we have 
selected a waypoint where we would like to split the route. The "Split 
Test" Route now consists of two parts, that has been renamed.</li>
    <li><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/orig1.png" alt="" height="359" width="600"></li>
    <li>Next we extend the first leg "Split Test_A" with the second leg

    <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Deletes selected route or track.</li>
    <li><strong>Export Route</strong>: Save the route on your computer for later use (import)</li>
    <li><strong>Send to GPS.</strong> Send the Route to your GPS. For <strong>Garmin Users</strong>,
 make sure that the ToolBox-&gt;GPS-&gt;"Use Garmin GRMN/GRMN(Host) mode
 for Waypoint and Route  uploads" box is ticked. The reason for this is 
that Garmin units cannot accept route uploads via NMEA0183.  This is a 
"design feature" of all Garmin receivers.<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Route23.png" alt="" height="252" width="500"></li>
    <li><strong>Delete All</strong>. Be careful. If you <strong>know</strong>
 you have saved the routes on your computer and are able to import the 
again, this is a simple way to clear the screen from routes. Better be 
safe than sorry, so save before deleting, if you want to be able to use 
the routes again.</li>
    <li><strong>Import</strong>. Import one or more previously saved Routes. It is possible to select and import multiple routes.</li>

    <li>If a Tidal Height Curve Dialog, for an individual tidal station 
is  shown on the screen, the tidal situation for this station will be 
tabulated along all route points in the route properties dialog. It is 
essential to enter a departure time and a planned speed. Once "Enter" is
 pressed the tidal column will show the nearest High or Low water 
considering the ETA at each waypoint.  <br>

    <li>The "&gt;" (meaning: "Now") departure time specification can be 
 entered if local PC time zone is selected. It differs from specifying 
the  same moment of time, but without the "Now" spec (e.g. "5/23/2011 
08:00"  vs. "&gt;"): <br>
     - "5/23/2011 08:00" - calculates departure at 0800 on May 23rd 2011 from the first waypoint of the route<br>
     - "&gt;" - issued at 0800 on May 23rd 2011 - calculates  departure 
Now from the current boat position, including the distance to  the first
 waypoint of the route</li>
    <li>If no tide dialog for any station is open and a waypoints name 
contains  the string @~~&lt;name&gt;, for example "@~~York Spit Light", 
then  the  tide report for the closest station with matching name is  
shown in the  tide column for this waypoint. The most appropriate tidal 
station for  each waypoint can thus be selected.</li>
    <li>When entering a departure time the ETA, Expected Time of Arrival will be shown, instead of ETE, Expected Time En-route.</li>
    <li>The individual waypoints "Description" field can contain the 
setting of planned speed  specific just to the next route leg (e.g. 
"VMG=4.5;") and/or the  specification of Estimated Time of Departure 
from this waypoint (e.g. " ETD=2/14/2011 12:00;"), allowing for planning
 extended stopovers. Time  can be specified as UT, LMT or local zone 
time at the PC (default).  <br>

    </ul>
    <li>Tracks are extended <em>backward,</em> based on the time-stamp 
sequence, a track  is selected, which ends as the latest one before the 
start of current  track.  Tracks are extended as a single segment if 
they share the extending  point, otherwise a new, disjoint segment is 
added. Joining 2 tracks  (i.e. extending a track) results in just 1 
track remaining. </li>
    <li>
    <p>If you have ever hit the Track icon by mistake, or closed down  
OpenCPN in the middle of a passage, you know that it's very frustrating 
it is,  to have a voyage split up in a number of different tracks that 
does not  come together.</p>
    <p>This can be fixed. Just select any number of tracks in the  Track
 tab of the Route Manager window, right click the mouse to bring up  the

<ul>
    <li>Layers are one or more routes, tracks or waypoints  that has 
been saved together in a gpx file. A layer is represented as a single 
gpx file. A layer is persistent and protected from changes. A waypoint 
in a gpx file for example, can be imported either as a "waypoint" or as a
 layer. The difference is that when imported as a layer it cannot be 
changed or deleted. To see if a waypoint, route or track, is a part of a
 layer, open properties and check the top of the dialog. If it is a part
 of layer, it will say so.<br>

    <p> </p>
    <li>Layers are useful for many things. It can for example be used to
 update charts with new navigation marks and dangers as per Notices to 
Mariners, and to add Radio Call-In Points or to build a database of 
lights and locations, that will be visible on chart regardless of 
current scale. See the first picture above. In the second picture, a 
very good celestial fix, plotted with a gpx script has been saved as a 
layer.</li>
    <li>More advanced uses could for example be an interactive cruising 
guide using the possibility to embed links in waypoint descriptions.</li>
    <li>Layers can be created in OpenCPN,  and saved as a gpxfile, or be created offline, manually or by scripts, for example.</li>
    <li>Layers that are saved in a directory called "layers", in the 
same place that holds your opencpn.ini(config) file, are automatically 
loaded on start of OpenCPN.<br>
    Easiest way to find this is to go to the <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/help.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="31" width="28"> - button in the ToolBar and look all the way down in the first tab (About).<br>
    In Linux create the directory: /home/$USER/.opencpn/layers.</li>
    <li>Any subdirectory in the layers directory,  is also loaded. To 
actually display these layers on startup, tick the box towards the 
bottom of the <a href="#Toolbox%20Settings"><em>Toolbox Settings</em></a> Etc tab.</li>
    <li>Layers worth keeping, could be kept in the mentioned "layers" 
directory and  visibility during a session can be handled through "Hide 
from Chart" or "Show on Chart" buttons. New layers, gpx files, can 
easily be added in a subdirectory of it's own.</li>
    <li>A few restrictions apply to layer marks. A layer mark cannot be 
used to set anchor-watch on. If right-click-selecting co-located 
objects, priority is given to non-layer objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary layer</strong>: Any gpx file can be imported 
as a  layer. This can be used for developing layers or for import from a
 user  defined directory with predefined layers, as necessary. Layers 
imported  this way will not be saved when closing down the computer, but
 can of  course be loaded again. More permanent layers should be kept in
 the  "layers" directory, as described above.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete: </strong>Unloads the layer, but doesn't of course touch the originally imported gpx file.</li>
    <li><strong>Hide from Chart</strong> or <strong>Show on Chart</strong> Controls if the marked layer is visible. The same thing can be achieved by clicking the "eye" to the left of the layers name.</li>
    <li><strong>Hide WPT Names</strong> Shows a visible layer without waypoint names. This helps to unclutter layers, when zoomed out.</li>
    <li><strong>List contents </strong>or <strong>Delist Contents  </strong>Listing is this context means showing the individual points in the layer as waypoints in the "Waypoints Tab"</li>
    <li><strong>Import GPX..</strong> and <strong>Export All..</strong> <strong>Warning</strong>
 these buttons has nothing to do with Layers. They work as if you are in
 an other tab. For import use "Import New Layers". For export, create 
layers as described above.</li>

How to use split and extend - an example.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt.png" alt="" height="284" width="600"><br>
<br>
Hm...a bit of a miss in the planning. An islet with a shallow bank 
extending southward on our route. We put two marks north of the 
obstruction and would like to include these in our route.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt1.png" alt="" height="438" width="600"><br>
<br>
The waypoint west of the islet is #2. We mark this in "Route 
Properties", from the right-click menu. The Button "Split Route" is 
highlighted, meaning it is available to use. This is exactly what we 
want to do, so we click the button and split the route at wpt #2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt2.png" alt="" height="245" width="600"><br>
<br>
Right click at #2 and choose "Append Waypoint",<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt3.png" alt="" height="429" width="600"><br>
<br>
Move the cursor to the first triangle, and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Then move the cursor to the second triangle , and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Same thing for the original wpt to the east of the islet.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt4.png" alt="" height="114" width="600"><br>
<br>
Click "Activate Route" to see that this extension worked.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt5.png" alt="" height="435" width="600"><br>
<br>
Once again mark  "Route Properties" in the right-click dialog. #3 is the
 last wpt in our "new" temporary route. The "Extend Route" button is 
highlighted, so we click it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt6.png" alt="" height="361" width="600"><br>
<br>
Open the Route Manager to view the result. Notice the naming of the 
routes. _B_plus is active. What remains is to delete route _B and to 
rename _B_plus to a suitable name, for example the name of your original
 route.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt7.png" alt="" height="172" width="600"><br>
<br>
Deleting route _B.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/incwpt8.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
And here is the finally adjusted route.<br>
<br>
This was just an exercise.....in real life, it would be easier to just 
move the existing waypoints in the route, to avoid the Islet.<br>

Creating and Importing Great Circle Routes</h3>
GPX import can be used for many things, three sample applications 
follows below. First, look at this picture. Planning a trip from Cape 
Town to Freemantle ?<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/gc.png" alt="" height="414" width="800"><br>
<p>Here you have two imported routes, the Southern route is a pure Great
 Circle, the middle route is a Composite Great Circle, and then the 
normal Rhumb Line furthest to the north.<br>
A Great Circle is the shortest distance between two point on the globe. A
 composite route is the same thing with the additional condition to stay
 below a limiting latitude, in this case 39°30'S. A rhumb line is a 
straight line on a Mercator chart. The Mercator projection is the 
standard for OpenCPN.</p>
Let us compare the distances involved.<br>
<ul>
    <li>The pure great circle is 4610 nautical miles (M)</li>
    <li>The great circle as plotted with 5° of longitude between the waypoints is 4627 M</li>
    <li>The pure composite route, limited by latitude 39°30’ S is 4651M</li>
    <li>The composite route as plotted with 3° of longitude between waypoints (for the great circles) is 4669 M.</li>
    <li>The rhumb  line is 4843 M.</li>
</ul>
So the advantage of a great circle is obvious. The disadvantages, in this case are many.<br>
Colder weather, stronger winds, higher seas and perhaps even icebergs. 
The great circle is just one factor in the decision making when planning
 a route, the weather is likely to be the deciding factor in most cases.<br>
<br>
A great circle route  is created with  the "gc" <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> script, that is cross platform.<br>
To create a gpx file containing a great circle you have to enter the 
departure points lat &amp; long, followed by the destination points lat 
&amp; long and the optionally a limiting latitude for composite sailing 
and the distance in long between waypoints, default is set to 5°.<br>

NOAAs  <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ship_obs.php">NDBC site</a> gives access to a lot of offshore observations from buoys and ships worldwide.<br>
To easy visualize all this data the "ShipWxRep" script transform a 
limited set of all the available data into gpx waypoints. The format, as
 seen above is "wind direction, wind speed, time for observation, and 
air pressure". This can be helpful when evaluating the accuracy of grib 
files, even though the best tool in this respect probably is a 
calibrated digital barometer.<br>

If you only have access to low bandwidth Internet, this script is a way 
to quickly plot the contents of, for example an email, containing the

  <h1 id="CM93 Offsets" class="book-heading">CM93 Offsets</h1>
  <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_lector"><strong>Caveat lector</strong></a><br>
There is absolutely no guarantee that a correction, based on one point, 
 as described below, will be valid for the whole chart cell. Be very  
careful when using this feature.<br>
<br>
Starting with offsets.
<ul>
    <li>Go to single chart (i.e. non-quilted) mode, with cm93 charts displayed. Use F9 to flip quilting on and off</li>
    <li>Zoom/Pan to the region of interest.</li>
    <li>Right click and activate "CM93 Offset Dialog"</li>
</ul>
  <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/offsets1.png" alt="" border="20" height="314" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="235"><br>
<ul>
    <li>In the list of cells/MCOVR IDs, selected the one MCOVR of 
interest.    The coverage area for this MCOVR object will be outlined 
with a heavy  yellow border.</li>
    <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/offsets2.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
    <br>
    <li>Some cells have built in corrections already applied. The values
 wgsox and wgsoy, are offsets to bring the original chart cell to WGS84.
 See the first and third cell in the picture above. The values are for 
information only, and cannot be changed. These corrections are generally
 correct, but not always. Sometimes the corrections are wrong and 
sometimes there are no corrections where there ought to be. This is 
where this manual offset feature comes in handy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In order to use this feature effectively, one needs a geographically  
known reference point.  As an example, say there is a NAVAID present on 
 the chart  cell with known WGS84 lat &amp; long, as from a light list. 
 In this case, one  can drop a waypoint on the chart, edit the waypoint 
properties to the  known lat/lon, and then use the CM93 Offset Dialog to
 slew the  cell/MCOVR so that the dropped waypoint coincides with the 
NAVAID  feature on the cm93 cell (chart).<br>
<br>
You may also use a geographical feature such as a Cape or point whose  
location is absolutely known, as by reference to observation, or by  
rendering on another, more accurate chart such as a trusted scanned  
raster chart or georeferenced photo chart.<br>
<br>
To see how this feature works, here is an example from the South Pacific.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/offsets4.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
This is Tongareva, also called Penhryn atoll. A mark, with a triangle is dropped at the westernmost point of the Island.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/offsets5.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Zooming
 out to next smaller scale chart makes the triangle mark jump NNE. Time 
for some corrections, as we, at least for the purpose of this example, 
are confident that the larger scale chart is correct.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/offsets6.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Quite large corrections brings the chart into reasonable agreement.  <br>
<ul>
    <li>Use the spin controls on the right side of the dialog to adjust 
the desired user offsets. It is also possible to write numbers directly.
 Notice that positive corrections is towards North and East.</li>
    <li>In some cases it is not clear exactly which M_COVR ID that 
represents your position. A simple test will reveal if a mark reacts to 
(large) corrections.</li>
    <li>The offsets are automatically saved in the binary MCOVR cache files found in the program data directory as CM93/...</li>
</ul>  </div>

  <h1 id="Anchor Watch" class="book-heading">Anchor Watch</h1>
  <h2 id=""> </h2>
Anchor watch can be set on any mark that you have created with OpenCPN, 
except for a mark that belongs to a layer, as long as the boat is within
 1 nautical mile of this mark. This means that the Anchor watch items, 
on the right click menu, will only be visible if  your boat is within 1 
nautical miles of a mark. If the boat is closer than 5 m to the mark the
 anchor watch can't be set either.<br>
  A maximum of two marks can have anchor watch set at the same time. Get
 around the restriction with a mark in a layer, by creating a new mark 
nearb<em>y.</em>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch1.png" alt="" height="398" width="400"></p>
This feature can be used in other situations than just anchoring, but 
keeping an eye on your anchor, and making sure it isn't dragging, is the
 main purpose. <br>
<br>
<strong>Basic usage</strong><br>
<br>
To learn how it works let's make a dry run to a nice trade wind anchorage.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch2.png" alt="" height="399" width="400"></div>
<br>
After circling around and exploring the bay, we know where we want to drop our anchor.<br>
At  the chosen spot we drop the anchor, at the same time we right click on the "Own Boat Icon" and press "drop Mark Here".<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch3.png" alt="" height="393" width="400"></div>
<br>
The wind, ENE at 15 kts let us drift back until we are satisfied with 
our scope. A burst in reverse convinces us that the anchor is set, later
 confirmed by a leisurely snorkeling over the anchor. Time to sort out 
the anchor watch<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"> </div>
<br>
Right click on the mark and press "Set Anchor Watch". The name of the 
mark changes to 50, and a green circle appears with a radius of 50 
meters.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch4.png" alt="" height="404" width="400"></div>
<br>
The anchor watch is now active, with a default max distance of 50m from 
the mark, and an alarm will be set off if the boat for some reason exits
 the circle. If "Play sound on CPA/TCPA Alerts" is set in the AIS 
ToolBox Tab, the  same audio alarm is activated together with the visual
 alarm on the  screen. To deactivate the anchor watch, right click on 
the mark and select "Clear Anchor Watch".<br>
<br>
If you are more than 50 m from the anchor when activating the watch this happens..<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch8.png" alt="" height="400" width="400"></div>
<br>
Sort this out by open the Mark/WP Properties Dialog.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch9.png" alt="" height="560" width="326"></div>
<br>
Change the name from "50 m" to a name that is relevant to the amount of 
chain and/or rode that you use, for example "75". Change the icon to, if
 you like. Pressing OK should stop the alarm.<br>
<br>
To get protection from the wind and a bit of northerly swell, we have 
really anchored to close to the beach. To keep an eye on this potential 
danger we set another mark on the beach.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch5.png" alt="" height="404" width="400"></div>
<br>
This time we change the "Mark Name" to -150, this means that if the boat
 comes within 150 meters of this mark, the alarm is set off. Green 
circle, OK to be inside. Red circle OK to be outside.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/Anch6.png" alt="" height="399" width="400"></div>
<br>
An hour later, after a heavy squall passed, the wind goes light and 
fluky. The boat drifts towards the beach and the anchor alarm sounds and
 comes up on our computer screen. <br>
The alarm sound is the same as the AIS warning sound and is set in the ToolBox under the AIS tab.<br>
<br>
<strong>Alternatives and Settings</strong><br>
A mark can also be created by hitting "Enter" or "Ctrl + M". The mark 
will be created at the position of the cursor. The anchor watch can now 
be set as demonstrated above with the default alarm distance being 
applied.<br>
<br>
A way to easily drop a mark, exactly at your current position, is to hit
 "Ctrl + Space". This is the "Man Over Board" shortcut. Right click and 
go to properties. Change the name to a suitable alarm distance and pick a
 different icon. Set the Anchor Watch.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/aa-mob.png" alt="" height="260" width="300"></div>
<div><br>
The picture is an illustration to what happens if you use the MOB 
keystroke, and then just activate the Anchor Watch. As the mark is 
already named, the default watch distance doesn't work. The green circle
 is the 5 m default minimum distance. The alarm goes off, of course.</div>
<br>
Both the default Anchor Watch Radius and Max distance  from mark can be 
changed by editing the configuration file, opencpn.ini on Windows and 
opencpn.config on Linux. <br>
Close down OpenCPN and open the configuration file in a text editor.<br>
Find the section that starts with "[Settings] ".<br>
Create two new lines, looking, for example like this.<br>
AnchorWatchDefault=45        (default is 50 m)<br>
AnchorWatchMax=2500         (default is 1852 m) <br>
Enter your own preferences, 45 &amp; 2500 are just for illustration.<br>

  <h1 id="Automatic Anchor Mark" class="book-heading">Automatic Anchor Mark</h1>
   <br>
Automatic Anchor Mark.  This is what it does:<br>
If the following are ALL true:<br>
1. In "Cruising" mode, meaning that speed has at some point exceeded 3.0 kts.<br>
2. Current speed is less than 0.5 kts.<br>
3. OpenCPN has been up at least 30 minutes<br>
4. OpenCPN is exiting normally<br>
5. There is no anchor watch set on an "anchor..." icon mark.<br>
6. Any "Anchorage - icon" waypoint within 0.25 NM of current GPS location is deleted.<br>
<br>
Then, OpenCPN will drop a waypoint at the current location, with the name - "Anchorage created on [Date Stamp]".<br>
<br>
Thus waypoints are automatically created for known good anchorages as you shut down the computer. <br>
The 0.25 NM condition prevents clogging up frequently visited anchorages with closely spaced waypoints.  <br>
The other conditions help to prevent spurious waypoints. <br>
<br>
<br>
To use this feature find opencpn.conf or opencpn.ini as it is called in windows.<br>
Search for a line like this:<br>
AutoAnchorDrop=0<br>
and change the value from "0" to "1".<br>  </div>

  <h1 id="Navigation Data Backup" class="book-heading">Navigation Data Backup</h1>
  Navigation data backup is implemented in 2.5. Rotating backups of 
navobejcts created on every program run. OpenCPN keeps backups of the 
last 5 runs. This can be changed.<br>
In the opencpn.ini/opencpn.config file you can find a configuration 
setting to control the number of backups kept, defaulting to <b>KeepNavobjBackups=5. </b>This value can be changed using a text editor.<br>
The backups are then stored in files navobj.xml.[1..x] (in the same 
directory as the ni file) where .1 is  always the newest backup and the 
oldest is removed on the next program  run. The file that will be loaded
 on next start is called navobj.xml.<br>
To load an old backup, exit the program. Find the backup you want to use. Rename it  navobj.xml. Start OpenCPN!<br>
<br>
The OpenCPN logfile also serves as a backupb through the "LOGBOOK:" entries.<br>
These can be used to reconstruct a  GPX track. A windows utility for hat purpose ia available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nohal/LogBookExtractor/downloads">https://github.com/nohal/LogBookExtractor/downloads</a>  </div>

  The core OpenCPN tries to keep features to a minimum so that it is 
lean, mean and easy to use. Features can still be added through the 
plugin infrastructure. The plugin interface has changed during the 2.6 
beta cycle. The plugins must use PlugIn API version to 1.8 to work with 
OpenCPN 2.6.1624, and later<br>
A number of new plugins were introduced with the 2.5 release, and the developmen has not slowed down since.<br>

  <h1 id="Grib Weather Plugin" class="book-heading">Grib Weather Plugin</h1>
  OpenCPN has a lightweight grib weather file viewer plugin, with a 
limited set of features, aimed at being useful while under way. It is 
not possible to download grib files from within OpenCPN. Many external 
sources for grib files are available on the Internet.  <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Grib-Files-Getting-And-Using">Franks-Weather </a> is a good starting point.<br>
<ul>
    <li>To display grib files as an overlay on your normal charts you have to first activate the grib icon <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/grib.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"></li>
    <li>Go to <img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/settings.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"> find the plugin tab. Click on the Grib plugin, then the "Enable" button. The "Prefence" Button brings up a small dialog. <br>
    <p><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/grib-plugin.png" alt="" height="712" width="600"></p>
    </li>
    <li>Tick the "Show GRIB Icon" box. Tick the next box as well, unless
 you are on old hardware. Not ticking the "High Definition Graphics" box
 can help to speed up the grib display, in such cases.</li>
    <li><img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/grib2.png" alt="" height="663" width="650"></li>
    <li>The Next step is to click the icon, which brings up the Grib 
Display Control. Use the upper part of this window to navigate to, and

control. See picture above.</li>
    <li>Click on the "&gt;" in front of the gribfile. The individual 
forecasts contained in the gribfile, is then displayed under the 
gribfile heading.</li>
    <li>Click on one of the forecasts and it will be displayed. When you
 move the cursor over the grib display, the values for wind etc will be 
displayed for the cursor position, in the lower part of the "Grib 
Display Control". Here you can select what grib values to view. Note 
that not all gribfiles contains wave data.</li>
    <li>When zoomed in to show just a small area of the chart, there may
 not be any wind-arrows visible. The relevant data will, however, still 
be displayed in the grib dialog. To see the wind arrows zoom out to view
 a larger area.</li>
    <li>The gribs are only displayed on the charts when the "Grib Display Control" dialog is open.</li>
    <li>For certain areas gribfiles describing currents are available<img src="OpenCPN%20User%20Manual_files/cur1_0.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="492" width="650"></li>
    <li>OpenCPN will display most grib file formats, but as it is a fairly new feature, bug reports are very welcome.</li>

    <li>If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you 
understand the basics, before you start to use them. It is essential to 
understand the limitations of weather forecasts in the grib format. It 
is also worth pointing out that gribs are <strong>not</strong> reliable near tropical systems, at least not when using gribs based on the very common GFS model.</li>

  The Dashboard pluging is able to show quite a few instruments. If the 
data is available to OpenCPN in the NMEA0183 data stream the different 
instruments will display relevant data. But...the plugin don't tell what
 is available. It is assumed that the user know what is connected. It is
 of course possible to activate all instruments and see what works.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Dahsboard in action, two Dashboards, one vertical and one 
horizontal. The ToolBar is hidden, as the "Full Screen" is shown. Grab 
the top Caption bar with the cursor and drag the Dashboard as far as 
possible to the right or left. Let go the cursor, and the Dashboard will
 dock, the chart display will adjust, no part of the chart will be 
hidden. Horizontal Dashboards can in a similar way be docked top or 
bottom.<br>
This process is reversible. Just grab the Dashboard dialog bar with the 
cursor, an pull towards the middle of the screen, and the Dashboard will
 become floating.<br>

  To convert a chart picture to a BSB chart, libbsb was for a long time the only choice.<br>
With the arrival of "imgkap", there is an alternative with updated features.<br>
Read more about imgkap here: <a href="http://www.dacust.com/inlandwaters/imgkap/">www.dacust.com/inlandwaters/imgkap/</a><br>
<br>
<h3 id="Picture to Chart, some details">Picture to Chart, some details</h3>
<br>
For both tiff2bsb(libbsb) and imgkap there must be a user supplied 
"header" file containing information and Geo-referencing of the chart 
picture. This file can be produced in different ways. From simple 
handcrafting, to a method described on the page "Conversion Using 
Linux", which actually applies to windows as well in many parts.<br>
<br>
To see a real header, just open a chart file (whatever.kap) in a text-editor.<br>
The first part of the text in the beginning us user supplied, then comes
 a text part created by libbsb or imgkap an then the binary part.<br>
Whatever method is used for conversion it is important to understand the header.<br>
Here is a commented header file originating from the NGA project, that describes the essential items in a basic version. <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>0. The BSB version used<br>
1. *Name of chart from the chart. Warning do not use commas ",".<br>
2. *Chart number. Plan A on 23456 should be named 23456_A<br>
3.  Size of picture Pixel x coordinate<br>
4.  Size of picture Pixel y coordinate<br>
5. *Scale of the chart from the chart.<br>
6. *Geodetic datum, for example WGS84, from the chart. I not defined on 
the chart write "UNKNOWN" No guesswork, it is either stated, or said to 
be a local datum, that cannot be related to WGS84. Charts released 
earlier than 1990 (?) and conforming to<br>
World Geodetic System should be WGS72, unless stated otherwise. The difference between WGS 84 and WGS 72 is minor.<br>
7. *Projection, almost always MERCATOR, a few charts are TRANSVERSE 
MERCATOR. We should not bother with other projections, GNOMONIC small 
scale great circle charts etc. If we come across large scale plans with 
GNOMONIC projection this should be used, say<br>
 1:50,000 or larger. High latitude "Lambert Conformal Conic Projection" 
should be skipped, for now. OpenCPN only handles Mercator and  
Transversal Mercator. I don't think th Polyconic charts.<br>
8. *For Mercator charts this is the latitude where the scale is valid. If available on the chart, use that value. <br>
If it is not available on the chart use the average value of the 
latitude of the upper and lower edge, to the nearest 1/10 of a degree. <br>
For Transverse Mercator charts use the average _longitude_  of the eastern and western edge. <br>
Treat a possible large scale gnomonic as a Mercator chart.<br>
8a. SK is the skew angle of charts that are not "North Up". For North Up the value is 0.0<br>
8b.TA is he text angle, more or less always 90.0<br>
9. Unit for soundings from the chart, mostly METERS<br>
10. Datum for soundings from the chart, for ex MLWS, LAT<br>
11. x and y resolution, meters per pixel. Not necessary for us to compute. OpenCPN andles this.<br>
12. Chart edition date copied from the chart,inf in SW corner, except, there must be _no_ commas.<br>
13. Our release edition.<br>
14. Our release date.<br>
16. Geo-referencing, standard case - simple 4 corner chart, use the 4 corners, starting in the SW corner proceeding clockwise. <br>
Format: x pix,y pix, lat, long. Lat &amp; long i decimal degrees, to 8 decimals, where N lat and E long are positive.<br>
One reason to use all 4 corners is to catch  skewed and warped charts, 
and calculate SK (8a), also to calculate a rotating angle for charts 
that are not properly aligned. <br>
17. Standard case, just copy the lat &amp; long from the REFs.<br>
18. Corrections in seconds of arc to bring the chart to WGS84. This is 
generally given on the chart(if they exist), in a format where the 
corrections are in minutes of arc for plotting a WGS84 position on the 
chart. This correction must be transformed to seconds of arc and the 
signs reversed.(we are doing the reverse to the case stated on the 
charts). These values are sometimes difficult to find on the chart. <br>
19. If a chart  spans the 180th meridian = &gt; CPH/180.0, else =&gt; 
CPH/0.0. So CPH/ is 0.0 for most charts. Note that OpenCPN handles 
transiting the 180:th meridian while a few other plotters don't.<br>
<br>
**IFM** is not used as tif2bsb and imgkap calculates this value and ads 
it to the header on the final kap, together with other values such as 
RGB. Any manually entered values will be overwritten.<br>
</blockquote> <br>
One great advantage with imgkap, compared to libbsb, is that generally 
the original format for the chart picture can be used directly.<br>
To calibrate a chart can be as simple as composing the headerfile , a 
text file with the extension ".txt". Often the Lat&amp;Long of the SW 
and NE corners are printed on the charts.<br>
Use, for example GIMP, to find the pixelcoordinates for each corner.<br>
<br>
For example, to the chart picture BA1121.jpg we write the header file  BA1121.txt.<br>
To create the chart file with the extension ".kap", issue the command:<br>
<br>
<em>imgkap BA1121.jpg BA1121.txt BA1121.kap</em><br>

  <h3 id="How to convert your chart images to a format that OpenCPN will read using Linux">How to convert your chart images to a format that OpenCPN will read using Linux</h3>
<p>Do you have a bunch of scanned charts of your area, in graphical format (jpg, tiff, etc.) and OpenCPN won't read them?<br>
Here's how you can – with a bit of work, sure, but worth the effort – convert them into usable electronic charts.</p>
<h4 id="The tools:">The tools:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ImageMagick: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" title="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org/</a>
 (Binary releases are available for a few distributions, for Ubuntu just
 get it with the package manager, it's in the repositories.)</li>
    <li>Libbsb: <a href="http://libbsb.sourceforge.net/" title="http://libbsb.sourceforge.net">http://libbsb.sourceforge.net</a>
 (You will need some version of libtiff-dev and libpng-dev installed to 
build it. A .deb package that worked fine for me can be found <a href="http://opencpn.org/libbsb">here</a>.</li>
    <li>mc2bsbh: you can get it <a href="http://www.dacust.com/inlandwaters/mapcal/index.html">here</a>.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the c++ source file, and from its directory, type:</li>
        <li>g++ -Wall -s -O2 mc2bsbh.cpp -o mc2bsbh</li>
        <li>It compiled without any problem on my (very standard) 
Karmic. I personally put it in /usr/local/bin, which I own as user, so 
it's in the PATH and can be called from anywhere, if you leave it in the
 working directory, use ./mc2bsbh</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>MapCal: part of the free navigation package SeaClear .<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Note: I had some problems running it with Wine (saving the 
calibration) but I can't reproduce the error and now it works fine. One 
suggestion is, make the directory you're going to write the calibration 
in world-writable before running MapCal.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The pcx2tif script (optional) , found <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/pcx2tif.zip">here</a>.
  This is a great little shell script by "taifun" used to convert old 
Maptech-style formats of tiled charts. If you find your chart is made of
 little bits instead of a whole file, this will stitch them all together
 in TIFF format.
    <ol>
        <li>Instructions for use are in the tarball.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Once we have the tools all set up, we can get to work. <strong>The process in in five steps:</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Convert a chart image to tiff with imagemagick.</li>
    <li>Convert it again to png with the same (you'll need both files).</li>
    <li>Load the png version of the chart in Mapcal and calibrate it.</li>
    <li>Generate the chart header with mc2bsbh, and make the .kap version of the chart, with libbsb.</li>
    <li>Copy the resulting .kap into opencpn's chart dir, and reload the chart database.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let's see them in detail:</strong></p>
<p><u>Steps 1 and 2:</u><br>
<br>
Say you have a chart in jpeg format called chart.jpg.<br>
<br>
From the command line, use:<br>
 convert chart.jpg -colors 127 chart.gif<br>
<br>
and then again,<br>
 convert chart.gif -colors 127 chart.tif<br>
<br>
and then again,<br>
 convert chart.jpg -colors 127 chart.png<br>
<br>
(there is a script that does this for multiple files, get it <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=12502&amp;d=1263164543">here</a>  , just remove the .doc extension, this is the example)<br>
Throw away the .gif file. Don't ask me why you need to generate it in 
the first place, but apparently you do, it's an imagemagick thing. Keep 
the .tif and the .png ones a while longer, though. You'll be even 
happier to get rid of them when you've finished.</p>
<p><u>Step 3:</u></p>
<ul>
    <li>Open MapCal.</li>
    <li>File, Open Image. Open the .png version of your chart. Ignore 
the data window for the moment, you'll do that later, click OK. You 
should see your chart.</li>
    <li>To calibrate it, choose a point near a corner for which it is 
easy to know lat/lon. Right-click on it, and choose Add New Cal. Point. 
To zoom in and out use the little + and – buttons at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Ignore the fact that Latitude has three integer figures, we're 
still talking about the Earth. Enter the coordinates and proceed for at 
least three more points, near the corners.</li>
    <li>Click Activate Changes. Check that the grid makes sense. Click Border, draw a border around the chart (that part is easy).</li>
    <li>You should also enter some data for the chart: Edit, Chart Information.</li>
    <li>The Chart Name will show up in OpenCPN to remind you of all your hard work, choose it well.</li>
    <li>For this example we'll just use “chart”.</li>
    <li>You should also enter at least Scale (found on the chart) Depth 
Units, Projection (Mercator most likely) and Datum (WGS84 most likely, 
but be careful with older charts). All of this information should be 
found on the chart itself.</li>
    <li>For more details, you have the SeaClear Manual.</li>
    <li>File, Save Calibration. Repeat ad-lib for any other charts and 
exit. If everything went well, you'll find a file called CHARTCAL.DIR in
 the same directory as you loaded your png chart from. This is used to 
(finally) make your calibrated chart that OpenCPN will use, as detailed 
in</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Step 4:</u></p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate the chart header from the command line:
    <ul>
        <li>mc2bsbh CHARTCAL.DIR</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should see:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Create CHART.hdr  <br>
        (the .hdr file must have DOS newlines)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>So type: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>tif2bsb -c 127 CHART.hdr chart.tif chart.kap</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>At which point you should have a chart.kap file that OpenCPN will happily use. <br>
    <ul>         This can be done for many charts at a time by using the <a href="http://www.dacust.com/inlandwaters/mapcal/mc2bsbh/tif2bsb_batch.sh">tif2bsb batch script</a> from the mc2bsbh page. If it gives you any problem with lowercase-uppercase names, try: <br>
        <strong><span>for i in `find * -depth`; do (mv $i `echo $i|tr [:upper:] [:lower:]`); done</span></strong><br>
        which will convert all files in the current directory to lowercase (works great for me).<br>
        If you get an error like /bin/bash^M, no such shell (I did), 
it's a cr/lf thing, just edit it, type [enter] at the end of each line 
(there's only 7) and get rid of the blank ones.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <ul>Proceed to install the filename(s).kap into OpenCPN (see<a href="#Installing%20Charts"> Installing Charts</a>) </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note 1: you can also make the .hdr file “manually”, using
 a template and entering the calibration data with a text editor, but I 
won't go into that for the moment.</em></p>
        <p><em>Note 2 (about the commands, so if there's any problem you know what to look for) :</em></p>
        <ol>             <strong><em>convert </em></strong><em>is a command from imagemagick.</em> <br>
            <strong><em>tif2bsb</em></strong><em> is a command from libbsb.</em><br>
            <strong><em>mc2bsbh</em></strong><em> is a standalone thing.</em>         </ol>
            <p><em>Note 3: (by Jonasberg, on the colors in the conversions) :</em></p>
            <ol>             <em>The "127" is the number of individual 
colors used. Sometimes it pays of to reduce this number to get a smaller
 file size, say, if you start with a bitmapped format like png that 
contains fewer colors.</em>         </ol>
                Note 4: On the joinpcx script:<br>
                <br>
                If you use it "standalone" and not as part of the "charts" script,  change the lines,<br>
                <span>convert new1.gif - colors 127 $1.tif<br>
                <span>(and .png) to</span><br>
                convert new1.gif -colors 127 `basename $PWD`.tif</span><br>
                (and .png) <br>
                because the "$1" will not create files with [directory_name].tif and .png, it won't create any files at all.<br>
                Using `basename $PWD`will make files called [current directory name].tif (and .png).<br>
                So just edit the script to whatever suits you best. <br>  </div>

and folders" and untick the box "Hide extensionsfor known file types". 
Other versions of Windows are similar, but may not be exactly like this.
 Now you should find the files we talked about in the previous 
paragraph. </li>
    <li><strong>I have a problem so I reinstalled - but that did not help. </strong>Try this approach instead - <a href="#Installing%20OpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></li>
    <li><strong>I get a lot of error messages when starting OpenCPN from the Linux commandline. </strong>   Messages like (opencpn:8979): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_drawable_get_size: assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE (drawable)' failed<br>

    are quite normal an has nothing to do with OpenCPN. Just ignore them.                     </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What are all those 'U' things all over my chart?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature being rendered is S57 Text relating to 'M_QUAL'.</p>
<p>This is a meta-object describing the quality of data shown. The 
Attribute of interest is CATZOC, or "Category of Zone of Confidence". 
The value on most US ENC's is "6", or "un-assessed". Thus, the 'U'.</p>
<p>You can turn this symbol off in OpenCPN by de-selecting the box next 
to M_QUAL in 'Tool Box' / 'Vector Charts' tab 'Mariners Standard' 
selection list box.<br>
Unticking the box "Meta Objects" also hides the "U" symbols.</p>
<p>To learn the acronyms used in this application search the S57 'Object and Attribute' catalog at: <a href="http://www.s-57.com/" title="http://www.s-57.com/">http://www.s-57.com/</a></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>I have routes and way points in Sea Clear and I would like to import them into OpenCPN. Can I do it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. I had originally created and maintained all my routes and 
waypoints in SeaClear, exported them, loaded them into GPSUtility (for 
Windows) and saved them as text files.</p>
<p>To import into OpenCPN  I opened all my text files (routes and 
waypoints) with GPSUtility, saved that out as one big gpx file, and 
loaded it into OpenCPN. Works like a champ.</p>
<p>I've edited them and saved them back out as GPX files with no trouble.</p>
<p>Individual routes can be edited and saved in appropriately named GPX files.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Whenever I try to open a particular chart OpenCPN crashes. What's going on?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are the chart file is corrupted. Note the name and number of 
the suspect chart and replace it with a fresh download. Read the log 
file that may contain relevant information refarding the chart. 
Sometimes the bad chart blocks OpenCPN from restarting. Follow these 
instructions instead - <a href="#Installing%20OpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OpenCPN and Great Circle Navigation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Raster charts display bearings and headings as straight, measurable 
lines on the chart. Similarly, Vector ENC's are rendered as Mercator 
projections in OpenCPN and most other ECS's for the same reason.</p>
<p>For typical coastal navigation, errors which occur using rhumb line 
instead of great circle calculations are small for the distances usually
 covered by one chart.</p>
<p>Mercator Charts and Mercator navigation is the standard for most 
navigational purposes. Other terms used instead of "Mercator Sailing" is
 "Loxodrome Sailing" or "Rhumb Line Sailing".</p>
<p>OpenCPN uses Mercator Sailing and cannot directly display Great 
Circles, but through GPX route import , Great Circle Routes can be used 
as explained on <a href="#Planning%20Data"><em>Planning Data</em></a> page in the wiki.</p>

  Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
 share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
 make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public 
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and 
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free 
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
 License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
 be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
 the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers 
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means 
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is 
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is 
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute 
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. <br>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
 or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
 to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the 
terms of this License. <br>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
 the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
 appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
 else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user 
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
 interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
 based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) <br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
 can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
 the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
 License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, <br>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
 give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
 performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
 corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange; or, <br>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
Subsection b above.) <br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
 means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special 
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
 the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the 
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise 
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
 who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will 
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
 its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
 so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
 any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who 
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
 could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely 
from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
 by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
 the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
 Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the 
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the 
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
 DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey 
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.<br>
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author<br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br>
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2<br>
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details<br>
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome<br>
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' <br>
for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
 you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright<br>
interest in the program `Gnomovision'<br>
(which makes passes at compilers) written <br>
by James Hacker.<br>

<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you 
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications 
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser 
General Public License instead of this License.  </div>

<div>libbsb is a portable C library for reading and writing BSB format image files, typically used for nautical charts.</div>
<div>A number of utilities to convert and work with BSB charts are 
included in the libbsb package. Sample files and instructions on using 
these tools are available on the Examples page.</div>
